Vanguard May Allow Bitcoin ETFs on Its Platform in Coming Years,"Odaily, Bloomberg's senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas recently commented on the X platform that asset management giant Vanguard may never launch a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). However, he anticipates that Vanguard might ""relax its stance"" in the next one to two years, allowing Bitcoin ETFs to be traded on its platform. This shift could occur especially if Bitcoin's price reaches $150,000 or $200,000, as the company may grow weary of constant inquiries from clients. Additionally, Vanguard's new CEO has connections with BlackRock, the parent company of IBIT.

Indian Supreme Court Questions Government's Cryptocurrency Regulation,"Foresight News, the Indian Supreme Court has raised concerns about the government's inadequate regulation of cryptocurrencies. The court highlighted the absence of a clear legal framework, which has led to Bitcoin transactions being viewed as informal and illegal cross-border fund transfers. Judges reminded the federal government that approximately two years ago, the Supreme Court had sought clarity on India's virtual currency policy. The judges emphasized that a complete ban on cryptocurrencies is not advisable, but some form of regulation is necessary. They noted that Bitcoin profits are subject to a 30% tax, indicating a degree of legal recognition for cryptocurrencies. The court argued that if taxation is imposed, then proper regulation should logically follow.

Powell Reiterates Concerns Over U.S. Fiscal Path Amid Debt Challenges,"BlockBeats, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has consistently highlighted the unsustainable nature of the United States' fiscal trajectory over the past seven years. Despite the Federal Reserve's lack of authority in setting fiscal policy, Powell has repeatedly addressed the federal deficit issue, emphasizing its long-term economic impact. In a 2018 press conference, shortly after assuming his role, Powell stated, ""We are on an unsustainable fiscal path, and this reality must be confronted sooner rather than later."" His stance remains unchanged, as evidenced by his recent warnings on April 16 about maintaining significant deficits during full employment, urging for solutions. On May 7, Powell reiterated that the national debt is on an unsustainable path, urging Congress to take corrective measures, while clarifying that it is not the Federal Reserve's place to offer specific recommendations. The urgency of the fiscal crisis intensified after Moody's downgraded the U.S. AAA rating last Friday. The agency warned that extending the 2017 tax cuts, as favored by Republicans, could increase the deficit by $4 trillion over the next decade. Powell and U.S. President Donald Trump have also differed on interest rate policies. Trump has recently pushed for rate cuts, while the Federal Reserve has maintained the benchmark rate at 4.25%-4.5% this month. The market anticipates two rate cuts later this year, starting in September. Powell's term as chairman is set to conclude in May next year, although his position as a board member will continue until January 2028.

Indian Supreme Court Questions Government's Cryptocurrency Regulation,"Foresight News, the Indian Supreme Court has raised concerns about the government's inadequate regulation of cryptocurrencies. The court highlighted the absence of a clear legal framework, which has led to Bitcoin transactions being viewed as informal and illegal cross-border fund transfers. Judges reminded the federal government that approximately two years ago, the Supreme Court had sought clarity on India's virtual currency policy. The judges emphasized that a complete ban on cryptocurrencies is not advisable, but some form of regulation is necessary. They noted that Bitcoin profits are subject to a 30% tax, indicating a degree of legal recognition for cryptocurrencies. The court argued that if taxation is imposed, then proper regulation should logically follow.

Solana's New Consensus Protocol Alpenglow Promises Enhanced Efficiency,"Foresight News, on May 19, Anza, a developer studio spun off from Solana Labs, introduced a new consensus layer protocol for Solana named Alpenglow. This protocol modifies the existing TowerBFT and PoH consensus mechanisms by incorporating new components, Votor and Rotor, to handle voting and block finality, and to enhance Solana's current block propagation protocol. Built on Turbine, Solana's version of sharding, it optimizes bandwidth usage through a single-layer relay node based on stake. Roger Wattenhover, Anza's Head of Research, stated at Solana Accelerate that the new consensus mechanism will significantly reduce transaction finality time from the current 12.8 seconds to 150 milliseconds. Alpenglow has completed prototype testing and is expected to deploy on the testnet by mid-2025, with mainnet deployment anticipated later in the year following approval through Solana Improvement Documents (SIMD). Compared to the current Solana mainnet, Alpenglow simplifies architecture and optimizes data propagation efficiency, making it suitable for high-frequency trading and real-time payments. Votor, a core component of Alpenglow, will replace TowerBFT by handling consensus logic. It operates through direct communication rather than the current node gossip model, using peer-to-peer communication and dynamic grouping strategies based on stake weight or geographical location. This reduces redundant message transmission and network latency. Votor introduces a tiered stake voting mechanism: if a block receives over 80% stake support in the first round, it is notarized immediately; if support is between 60% and 80%, a second round of rapid confirmation is initiated. Nodes can skip voting if block delay or risk is detected, preventing resource wastage. Overall, when the validator threshold is below 60%, latency can be controlled to around 100 milliseconds. Rotor focuses on improving block propagation efficiency and network resource allocation by integrating Turbine sharding technology. It replaces the traditional multi-layer relay model with a single-layer relay node architecture, splitting block data into lightweight shards and dynamically optimizing transmission paths, significantly reducing network complexity and transmission delay. Rotor also introduces an adaptive propagation algorithm that monitors network status in real-time and switches congested paths, combining lightweight data verification to reduce computational overhead, greatly enhancing propagation speed and fault tolerance. Performance-wise, Rotor compresses block propagation delay to milliseconds, supporting Solana's goal of achieving 50,000 TPS, meeting the demands of DeFi clearing and real-time payment scenarios. Overall, the Alpenglow protocol removes the PoH mechanism, reducing chain-wide operational risk and simplifying architecture. By replacing Tower BFT consensus with Votor and using stake-driven 1-2 round voting, it achieves block finality within 100-150 milliseconds without relying on optimistic confirmation. Rotor optimizes Turbine sharding with a single-layer relay system, enhancing propagation efficiency to the physical network latency limit, with the main bottleneck being underlying network transmission speed. The system's resilience is significantly enhanced, capable of withstanding 20% malicious nodes and 20% stake offline scenarios, improving attack resistance and fault tolerance. Ultimately, Alpenglow compresses transaction finality to milliseconds, providing foundational support for high-frequency trading, real-time payments, and large-scale on-chain applications.

However, the forecast for the terminal rate remains unchanged at 3.00%-3.25%. The Federal Reserve is expected to implement quarterly rate cuts, with the terminal rate now projected to be reached by September 2026. The necessity for immediate rate cuts has diminished due to a more accommodative financial environment, lower tariffs, and stronger-than-expected macroeconomic data from April. Despite these short-term factors, long-term indicators such as structural growth slowdown and sluggish credit growth continue to suggest further rate cuts in the future.

Solana's New Consensus Protocol Alpenglow Promises Enhanced Efficiency,"Foresight News, on May 19, Anza, a developer studio spun off from Solana Labs, introduced a new consensus layer protocol for Solana named Alpenglow. This protocol modifies the existing TowerBFT and PoH consensus mechanisms by incorporating new components, Votor and Rotor, to handle voting and block finality, and to enhance Solana's current block propagation protocol. Built on Turbine, Solana's version of sharding, it optimizes bandwidth usage through a single-layer relay node based on stake. Roger Wattenhover, Anza's Head of Research, stated at Solana Accelerate that the new consensus mechanism will significantly reduce transaction finality time from the current 12.8 seconds to 150 milliseconds. Alpenglow has completed prototype testing and is expected to deploy on the testnet by mid-2025, with mainnet deployment anticipated later in the year following approval through Solana Improvement Documents (SIMD). Compared to the current Solana mainnet, Alpenglow simplifies architecture and optimizes data propagation efficiency, making it suitable for high-frequency trading and real-time payments. Votor, a core component of Alpenglow, will replace TowerBFT by handling consensus logic. It operates through direct communication rather than the current node gossip model, using peer-to-peer communication and dynamic grouping strategies based on stake weight or geographical location. This reduces redundant message transmission and network latency. Votor introduces a tiered stake voting mechanism: if a block receives over 80% stake support in the first round, it is notarized immediately; if support is between 60% and 80%, a second round of rapid confirmation is initiated. Nodes can skip voting if block delay or risk is detected, preventing resource wastage. Overall, when the validator threshold is below 60%, latency can be controlled to around 100 milliseconds. Rotor focuses on improving block propagation efficiency and network resource allocation by integrating Turbine sharding technology. It replaces the traditional multi-layer relay model with a single-layer relay node architecture, splitting block data into lightweight shards and dynamically optimizing transmission paths, significantly reducing network complexity and transmission delay. Rotor also introduces an adaptive propagation algorithm that monitors network status in real-time and switches congested paths, combining lightweight data verification to reduce computational overhead, greatly enhancing propagation speed and fault tolerance. Performance-wise, Rotor compresses block propagation delay to milliseconds, supporting Solana's goal of achieving 50,000 TPS, meeting the demands of DeFi clearing and real-time payment scenarios. Overall, the Alpenglow protocol removes the PoH mechanism, reducing chain-wide operational risk and simplifying architecture. By replacing Tower BFT consensus with Votor and using stake-driven 1-2 round voting, it achieves block finality within 100-150 milliseconds without relying on optimistic confirmation. Rotor optimizes Turbine sharding with a single-layer relay system, enhancing propagation efficiency to the physical network latency limit, with the main bottleneck being underlying network transmission speed. The system's resilience is significantly enhanced, capable of withstanding 20% malicious nodes and 20% stake offline scenarios, improving attack resistance and fault tolerance. Ultimately, Alpenglow compresses transaction finality to milliseconds, providing foundational support for high-frequency trading, real-time payments, and large-scale on-chain applications.

Built on Turbine, Solana's version of sharding, it optimizes bandwidth usage through a single-layer relay node based on stake. Roger Wattenhover, Anza's Head of Research, stated at Solana Accelerate that the new consensus mechanism will significantly reduce transaction finality time from the current 12.8 seconds to 150 milliseconds. Alpenglow has completed prototype testing and is expected to deploy on the testnet by mid-2025, with mainnet deployment anticipated later in the year following approval through Solana Improvement Documents (SIMD). Compared to the current Solana mainnet, Alpenglow simplifies architecture and optimizes data propagation efficiency, making it suitable for high-frequency trading and real-time payments. Votor, a core component of Alpenglow, will replace TowerBFT by handling consensus logic. It operates through direct communication rather than the current node gossip model, using peer-to-peer communication and dynamic grouping strategies based on stake weight or geographical location. This reduces redundant message transmission and network latency. Votor introduces a tiered stake voting mechanism: if a block receives over 80% stake support in the first round, it is notarized immediately; if support is between 60% and 80%, a second round of rapid confirmation is initiated. Nodes can skip voting if block delay or risk is detected, preventing resource wastage. Overall, when the validator threshold is below 60%, latency can be controlled to around 100 milliseconds. Rotor focuses on improving block propagation efficiency and network resource allocation by integrating Turbine sharding technology. It replaces the traditional multi-layer relay model with a single-layer relay node architecture, splitting block data into lightweight shards and dynamically optimizing transmission paths, significantly reducing network complexity and transmission delay. Rotor also introduces an adaptive propagation algorithm that monitors network status in real-time and switches congested paths, combining lightweight data verification to reduce computational overhead, greatly enhancing propagation speed and fault tolerance. Performance-wise, Rotor compresses block propagation delay to milliseconds, supporting Solana's goal of achieving 50,000 TPS, meeting the demands of DeFi clearing and real-time payment scenarios. Overall, the Alpenglow protocol removes the PoH mechanism, reducing chain-wide operational risk and simplifying architecture. By replacing Tower BFT consensus with Votor and using stake-driven 1-2 round voting, it achieves block finality within 100-150 milliseconds without relying on optimistic confirmation. Rotor optimizes Turbine sharding with a single-layer relay system, enhancing propagation efficiency to the physical network latency limit, with the main bottleneck being underlying network transmission speed. The system's resilience is significantly enhanced, capable of withstanding 20% malicious nodes and 20% stake offline scenarios, improving attack resistance and fault tolerance. Ultimately, Alpenglow compresses transaction finality to milliseconds, providing foundational support for high-frequency trading, real-time payments, and large-scale on-chain applications.

Future of Blockchain Development: Focus on Application Chains,"Odaily, on May 20, Tabi founder Xavier highlighted the shift in successful blockchain strategies. Historically, public chains thrived on innovative applications within their ecosystems, such as Ethereum's ICO and DeFi Summer. However, as the industry matures, this traditional approach is becoming less effective. Xavier emphasized HyperliquidX as a model of the 'fat application, thin protocol' concept, indicating a new direction for public chain development. Instead of numerous decentralized applications (DApps), future public chains should concentrate on the application chain model to enhance efficiency and practicality. Application chains may be crucial for the next generation of successful public chains. Xavier also acknowledged Cosmos for its contributions to the application chain sector. Concepts like account abstraction and inter-chain communication provide essential theoretical foundations for the future development of Layer 1 blockchains.

Solana's New Consensus Protocol Alpenglow Promises Enhanced Efficiency,"Foresight News, on May 19, Anza, a developer studio spun off from Solana Labs, introduced a new consensus layer protocol for Solana named Alpenglow. This protocol modifies the existing TowerBFT and PoH consensus mechanisms by incorporating new components, Votor and Rotor, to handle voting and block finality, and to enhance Solana's current block propagation protocol. Built on Turbine, Solana's version of sharding, it optimizes bandwidth usage through a single-layer relay node based on stake. Roger Wattenhover, Anza's Head of Research, stated at Solana Accelerate that the new consensus mechanism will significantly reduce transaction finality time from the current 12.8 seconds to 150 milliseconds. Alpenglow has completed prototype testing and is expected to deploy on the testnet by mid-2025, with mainnet deployment anticipated later in the year following approval through Solana Improvement Documents (SIMD). Compared to the current Solana mainnet, Alpenglow simplifies architecture and optimizes data propagation efficiency, making it suitable for high-frequency trading and real-time payments. Votor, a core component of Alpenglow, will replace TowerBFT by handling consensus logic. It operates through direct communication rather than the current node gossip model, using peer-to-peer communication and dynamic grouping strategies based on stake weight or geographical location. This reduces redundant message transmission and network latency. Votor introduces a tiered stake voting mechanism: if a block receives over 80% stake support in the first round, it is notarized immediately; if support is between 60% and 80%, a second round of rapid confirmation is initiated. Nodes can skip voting if block delay or risk is detected, preventing resource wastage. Overall, when the validator threshold is below 60%, latency can be controlled to around 100 milliseconds. Rotor focuses on improving block propagation efficiency and network resource allocation by integrating Turbine sharding technology. It replaces the traditional multi-layer relay model with a single-layer relay node architecture, splitting block data into lightweight shards and dynamically optimizing transmission paths, significantly reducing network complexity and transmission delay. Rotor also introduces an adaptive propagation algorithm that monitors network status in real-time and switches congested paths, combining lightweight data verification to reduce computational overhead, greatly enhancing propagation speed and fault tolerance. Performance-wise, Rotor compresses block propagation delay to milliseconds, supporting Solana's goal of achieving 50,000 TPS, meeting the demands of DeFi clearing and real-time payment scenarios. Overall, the Alpenglow protocol removes the PoH mechanism, reducing chain-wide operational risk and simplifying architecture. By replacing Tower BFT consensus with Votor and using stake-driven 1-2 round voting, it achieves block finality within 100-150 milliseconds without relying on optimistic confirmation. Rotor optimizes Turbine sharding with a single-layer relay system, enhancing propagation efficiency to the physical network latency limit, with the main bottleneck being underlying network transmission speed. The system's resilience is significantly enhanced, capable of withstanding 20% malicious nodes and 20% stake offline scenarios, improving attack resistance and fault tolerance. Ultimately, Alpenglow compresses transaction finality to milliseconds, providing foundational support for high-frequency trading, real-time payments, and large-scale on-chain applications.

U.S. Economic Official Criticizes Moody's Credit Rating Decision,"Odaily, the Director of the U.S. National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, has criticized Moody's decision to downgrade the U.S. credit rating, describing it as an outdated perspective. He emphasized the Trump administration's commitment to reducing federal spending. Hassett stated, ""There is no doubt that U.S. Treasury bonds are the safest investment on Earth. No country's bonds are more desirable to hold than U.S. Treasuries, so Moody's can do as it wishes."" He added that the decision reflects a backward-looking approach, penalizing the current administration for the previous administration's reckless spending. Hassett further noted, ""We are cutting spending and deregulating. We have supply-side growth, giving us every reason to believe we will have the world's best economy. If you have the world's best economy, you also have the world's best debt. That's my assessment.""

Solana's New Consensus Protocol Alpenglow Promises Enhanced Efficiency,"Foresight News, on May 19, Anza, a developer studio spun off from Solana Labs, introduced a new consensus layer protocol for Solana named Alpenglow. This protocol modifies the existing TowerBFT and PoH consensus mechanisms by incorporating new components, Votor and Rotor, to handle voting and block finality, and to enhance Solana's current block propagation protocol. Built on Turbine, Solana's version of sharding, it optimizes bandwidth usage through a single-layer relay node based on stake. Roger Wattenhover, Anza's Head of Research, stated at Solana Accelerate that the new consensus mechanism will significantly reduce transaction finality time from the current 12.8 seconds to 150 milliseconds. Alpenglow has completed prototype testing and is expected to deploy on the testnet by mid-2025, with mainnet deployment anticipated later in the year following approval through Solana Improvement Documents (SIMD). Compared to the current Solana mainnet, Alpenglow simplifies architecture and optimizes data propagation efficiency, making it suitable for high-frequency trading and real-time payments. Votor, a core component of Alpenglow, will replace TowerBFT by handling consensus logic. It operates through direct communication rather than the current node gossip model, using peer-to-peer communication and dynamic grouping strategies based on stake weight or geographical location. This reduces redundant message transmission and network latency. Votor introduces a tiered stake voting mechanism: if a block receives over 80% stake support in the first round, it is notarized immediately; if support is between 60% and 80%, a second round of rapid confirmation is initiated. Nodes can skip voting if block delay or risk is detected, preventing resource wastage. Overall, when the validator threshold is below 60%, latency can be controlled to around 100 milliseconds. Rotor focuses on improving block propagation efficiency and network resource allocation by integrating Turbine sharding technology. It replaces the traditional multi-layer relay model with a single-layer relay node architecture, splitting block data into lightweight shards and dynamically optimizing transmission paths, significantly reducing network complexity and transmission delay. Rotor also introduces an adaptive propagation algorithm that monitors network status in real-time and switches congested paths, combining lightweight data verification to reduce computational overhead, greatly enhancing propagation speed and fault tolerance. Performance-wise, Rotor compresses block propagation delay to milliseconds, supporting Solana's goal of achieving 50,000 TPS, meeting the demands of DeFi clearing and real-time payment scenarios. Overall, the Alpenglow protocol removes the PoH mechanism, reducing chain-wide operational risk and simplifying architecture. By replacing Tower BFT consensus with Votor and using stake-driven 1-2 round voting, it achieves block finality within 100-150 milliseconds without relying on optimistic confirmation. Rotor optimizes Turbine sharding with a single-layer relay system, enhancing propagation efficiency to the physical network latency limit, with the main bottleneck being underlying network transmission speed. The system's resilience is significantly enhanced, capable of withstanding 20% malicious nodes and 20% stake offline scenarios, improving attack resistance and fault tolerance. Ultimately, Alpenglow compresses transaction finality to milliseconds, providing foundational support for high-frequency trading, real-time payments, and large-scale on-chain applications.
Trading Pair: SOL
Price Change: +2.33%",2025-05-20,SOL,+2.33%,"Foresight News, on May 19, Anza, a developer studio spun off from Solana Labs, introduced a new consensus layer protocol for Solana named Alpenglow. This protocol modifies the existing TowerBFT and PoH consensus mechanisms by incorporating new components, Votor and Rotor, to handle voting and block finality, and to enhance Solanas current block propagation protocol. Built on Turbine, Solanas version of sharding, it optimizes bandwidth usage through a singlelayer relay node based on stake. Roger Wattenhover, Anzas Head of Research, stated at Solana Accelerate that the new consensus mechanism will significantly reduce transaction finality time from the current 12.8 seconds to 150 milliseconds. Alpenglow has completed prototype testing and is expected to deploy on the testnet by mid2025, with mainnet deployment anticipated later in the year following approval through Solana Improvement Documents SIMD. Compared to the current Solana mainnet, Alpenglow simplifies architecture and optimizes data propagation efficiency, making it suitable for highfrequency trading and realtime payments. Votor, a core component of Alpenglow, will replace TowerBFT by handling consensus logic. It operates through direct communication rather than the current node gossip model, using peertopeer communication and dynamic grouping strategies based on stake weight or geographical location. This reduces redundant message transmission and network latency. Votor introduces a tiered stake voting mechanism if a block receives over 80 stake support in the first round, it is notarized immediately if support is between 60 and 80, a second round of rapid confirmation is initiated. Nodes can skip voting if block delay or risk is detected, preventing resource wastage. Overall, when the validator threshold is below 60, latency can be controlled to around 100 milliseconds.

SEC Chair Advocates for Proactive Cryptocurrency Regulation,"PANews, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins addressed the SEC Speaks conference, highlighting the agency's past passive stance on cryptocurrency regulation. Atkins criticized the previous ""ostrich policy"" approach, which shifted to enforcement before accountability, resulting in a lack of trust. He emphasized the need for regulatory bodies to engage actively with the market and adapt rules to accommodate new technologies. Despite the SEC's stated willingness to communicate with potential registrants, regulatory requirements have not been adjusted, and leadership has historically hindered staff from discussing complex legal issues with market participants. Atkins has now directed the Division of Corporation Finance to engage transparently with the public. The SEC's policy divisions are currently drafting proposals for cryptocurrency-related rules, although staff members continue to address obstacles through staff-level statements, such as FAQs issued by the Division of Trading and Markets. While these staff opinions do not constitute official rules or regulations, they offer valuable insights to the public. Atkins also expressed a desire for the commission to allow SEC registrants to custody and trade both securities and non-securities under one roof. Additionally, he has requested congressional approval to reallocate funds to integrate the Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology (FinHub) into other SEC departments. This move aims to embed innovation into the SEC's core culture, as FinHub is currently viewed as an enforcement tool with limited scale and efficiency.

Market News: U.S. 30-Year Treasury Yield Surges Above 5% Following Moody’s Downgrade and Fiscal Concerns,"Jim Bianco, head of Bianco Research, “The last time the 30-year Treasury yield closed at or above 5% was on October 31, 2023. The highest closing yield in recent history was 5.11% on October 19, 2023—the most elevated level since July 2007.” The current yield stands just 12 basis points below that milestone.Foreign Holdings Shift: UK Overtakes China as Second-Largest Treasury HolderAmid shifting global capital flows, the United Kingdom surpassed China in March 2025 to become the second-largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasuries, with holdings totaling $779.3 billion, trailing only Japan. Both China and Japan have steadily reduced their exposure to U.S. debt over the past 12 months, signaling waning international demand for U.S. sovereign bonds.This decline in foreign participation underscores the growing need for the U.S. to attract new domestic or institutional buyers to absorb expanding bond issuance—particularly as fiscal deficits widen and Treasury supply increases.Risk-Off Sentiment Deepens Across MarketsThe bond market’s sell-off has rippled into broader risk assets. Nasdaq futures declined by approximately 2%, reflecting growing investor caution. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC), which traded near $75,000 during April’s yield spike, has since recovered to $103,000, after reaching $106,000 over the weekend.Rising yields, elevated supply expectations, and declining foreign demand together represent a challenging macroeconomic environment for U.S. policymakers. Continued pressure on long-term rates could impact financing conditions, equity valuations, and digital asset flows in the months ahead.

This imbalance suggests that an upward breakout may face minimal resistance, allowing for a potential rally toward new record highs if triggered by a strong catalyst.At the same time, some analysts caution that the sudden price movement may have been the result of a stop-loss sweep. This tactic is commonly used to trigger liquidations and create favorable entry points for new short positions by driving up price temporarily.Strategic Positioning: New Shorts at $107K May BackfireThe recent price spike to $107,000 may have lured short traders into opening positions, placing stop-loss levels above $110,000. Should bullish momentum return, these stop losses could be triggered en masse, further fueling an upward thrust through price acceleration via forced buybacks.While short-term movements remain speculative, the underlying market structure and diminished resistance above $107,000 increase the likelihood of a decisive move—either driven by market fundamentals or an external catalyst.

Crypto News: US Crypto Investment Products Surpass $7.5B in 2025 Inflows as Institutional Demand Recovers,"CoinShares, United States-based crypto investment funds have recorded over $7.5 billion in inflows year-to-date (YTD), fully recovering from the nearly $7 billion in outflows seen during February and March. According to a May 19 report by digital asset manager CoinShares, the latest weekly inflow totaled $785 million, marking the fifth consecutive week of net positive flows. Bitcoin and Ethereum Lead Inflows Amid Renewed Market ConfidenceThe majority of last week’s inflows were directed toward Bitcoin (BTC) products, which attracted $557 million, followed by Ethereum (ETH) products with $205 million. The recent increase in ETH inflows—its highest since March—coincided with the successful implementation of the Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7 and introduced features such as higher staking limits and account abstraction through EIP-7702.Ethereum’s YTD inflows now exceed $575 million. CoinShares attributes this renewed interest to both technical improvements and the appointment of Tomasz Stańczak as co-executive director of the Ethereum Foundation.Geographical Breakdown: US Dominates Inflows, Followed by Germany and Hong KongThe United States accounted for the bulk of recent inflows, contributing $681 million, followed by Germany with $86.3 million and Hong Kong with $24.4 million. The report notes that Hong Kong's inflow is its highest since November 2024.The shift in sentiment followed the White House’s May 12 announcement of a 90-day pause on new tariffs, which led to a notable 24% cut in U.S.-China import tariffs. The market reaction was swift: the following day, Coinbase recorded a withdrawal of 9,739 BTC, valued at over $1 billion, marking the largest net outflow from the exchange in 2025. Analysts suggest this move may signal growing institutional appetite for long-term holdings. Bitcoin ETF Market Recovers from Q1 OutflowsSpot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. also saw a substantial rebound. After registering $3.56 billion in outflows in February and $767 million in March, these ETFs absorbed $2.64 billion in May alone, according to SoSoValue data. While inflows moderated compared to previous weeks, demand remains robust despite the Federal Reserve’s continued hawkish tone on interest rates.Meanwhile, short Bitcoin products recorded their fourth consecutive week of inflows, suggesting some investors are maintaining hedging strategies or anticipating short-term volatility.Solana Sees Modest Outflows Amid Broader Market RecoveryAmong major altcoins, Solana (SOL) investment products were the only category to experience net outflows last week, with $890,000 withdrawn. This contrasts with broader market trends, as most crypto investment products recorded net gains.

Australian Court Ruling May Lead to Significant Bitcoin Tax Refunds,"Odaily, a recent court ruling in Australia could result in a $640 million tax refund related to Bitcoin. Judge Michael O'Connell of Victoria ruled in a theft case involving 81.6 Bitcoins, valued at approximately $13 million, that Bitcoin should be considered currency rather than a taxable asset. This decision challenges the Australian Taxation Office's (ATO) stance since 2014, which has classified cryptocurrencies as capital gains tax (CGT) assets. Tax lawyer Adrian Cartland noted that if the ruling is upheld on appeal, Bitcoin traders could receive refunds totaling 1 billion Australian dollars, or about $640 million. The ATO has not yet confirmed the specific refund amount. Notably, the judge compared Bitcoin to the Australian dollar rather than stocks or gold, suggesting that Bitcoin transactions might be exempt from the current CGT framework. Previously, the ATO required that any disposal of Bitcoin, including converting it to fiat currency, trading it for other cryptocurrencies, or purchasing goods, constituted a CGT taxable event.

XRP Faces Potential Decline Amid Bearish Patterns and Decreasing Trader Confidence,"Cointelegraph, the XRP cryptocurrency is exhibiting signs of a potential downturn as a classic head-and-shoulders pattern emerges on lower timeframes. This bearish technical formation, coupled with significant long liquidations and declining open interest, suggests weakening trader confidence in XRP futures. The head-and-shoulders pattern, identified on XRP's four-hour chart since May 9, indicates a possible 14% price drop. This pattern, known for signaling trend reversals, consists of three peaks: a higher peak (head) and two lower peaks (shoulders). The pattern is confirmed when the price breaks below the neckline, which connects the lows of the left and right shoulders, suggesting a potential sell signal. In XRP's case, the pattern was validated when the price fell below the neckline at $2.33 during early Asian trading hours on May 19. If the price remains below this level, the XRP/USD pair could further decline to $2.25, where the 200-day simple moving average currently resides, and potentially reach the pattern target of $2.00, marking a total loss of 14% from current levels. As reported by Cointelegraph, the possibility of a decline to as low as $2.00 is currently unfolding as bullish momentum wanes. Analyst Egrag Crypto emphasizes the importance of maintaining support at $2.30, which aligns with the head-and-shoulders neckline, to prevent a breakdown toward lower targets. The analyst's chart indicates that a drop below $2.30 could initiate a substantial sell-off, with initial targets around $2.15 and potentially as low as $1.60. In addition to the technical patterns, XRP's open interest has decreased by 18% to $4.49 billion over the past five days, signaling reduced trader confidence and liquidity, which contributes to downward price pressure. The recent decline in XRP's price has also led to liquidations, with long positions valued at $12 million being forcibly closed, compared to just $1.4 million in shorts. This scenario reflects increased selling pressure as bullish traders are compelled to sell at a loss, further driving prices lower. Notably, XRP's 3% drop over the last 24 hours is accompanied by a 70% surge in daily trading volume to $4.1 billion. An increase in trading volume amid a price decline can be interpreted as growing bearish momentum or repositioning by crypto traders as they anticipate XRP's next move.

Most initial voucher holders are based in Japan, and EMURGO has supported IOG in contacting these holders to facilitate redemption. Despite some success in locating holders, a portion remains untraceable. The Shelley hard fork rendered ongoing voucher redemption ADA unusable, necessitating a transfer to continue the redemption process. The identification process was carried out by local third parties using various investigative methods, including home visits. EMURGO acknowledges the community's expectations for transparency and supports IOG in conducting an independent audit. The company urges the community to be patient while awaiting the audit results, assuring that all pending issues will be resolved once the audit is completed.

Bitdeer Reports Decline in Revenue Amid Rising Electricity Costs,"PANews, Bitdeer Technologies Group (Btdr.US) has released its financial results for the first quarter of the 2025 fiscal year. The company reported a revenue of $70.1 million, marking a 41.3% decrease compared to the same period last year, but a 1.6% increase from the previous quarter. Revenue from self-operated businesses amounted to $37.2 million, a 10.4% year-over-year decline. The company faced a comprehensive gross loss of $3.2 million, with a gross margin of -4.6%. This was primarily due to increased electricity costs during Bhutan's dry season, which led to a temporary shutdown of its mining operations there. However, electricity prices have since returned to $0.042 per kWh as the wet season commenced. Bitdeer also reported $4.1 million in sales from its Seal mining machines, marking the official start of its mining equipment sales.The adjusted EBITDA was a negative $56.1 million, compared to a positive $27.3 million in the same quarter of 2024. Net profit reached $410 million, largely due to the reversal of fair value adjustments on convertible notes and Tether options from the fourth quarter of 2024.Bitdeer's prepaid expenses rose to $382 million in the first quarter of 2025, up from $310 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, covering the maximum wafer volume required. The Seal02 mining machines have entered the shipping phase, with future operations and sales dependent on competitor pricing strategies. The Seal03 machines completed wafer production in the first quarter and are currently in testing, with deployment and sales expected by late third or fourth quarter of 2025.In response to U.S. tariff challenges, Bitdeer plans to complete its North American assembly plant in the second quarter, allowing for localized assembly despite a nearly 10% cost increase. This is considered negligible compared to Southeast Asian tariffs. The Southeast Asian plant will continue to serve non-U.S. markets.Globally, Bitdeer is rapidly expanding its power infrastructure, with available capacity expected to reach 1.6GW by the end of the second quarter and 1.8GW by year-end. As of April, Bitdeer's self-operated mining hash rate reached 12.5 Eh/s, with projections to increase to 40 Eh/s by October and exceed 40 Eh/s by the end of 2025. The latest Seal01 and Seal02 machines were deployed in March, maintaining mining costs at least 20% lower than competitors. The replacement of outdated machines is expected to further enhance cost advantages, with exponential production growth anticipated from the second quarter.Bitcoin prices have recently rebounded, potentially surpassing the previous high of $109,000 per coin. The U.S. dollar has been under pressure since the trade war, enhancing Bitcoin's appeal as a safe-haven asset. The Federal Reserve's recent adoption of an ""average inflation"" policy could lead to interest rate cuts as early as June, with expectations for three cuts this year, supporting Bitcoin prices. Bitdeer is poised for significant developments following a transitional period in late 2024 and early 2025, with mining machine development and self-operated mining expansion being key focus areas. The first quarter of 2025 is expected to be the company's weakest period over the next two years, marking a turning point in operations, making it a top choice among North American Bitcoin mining stocks.
