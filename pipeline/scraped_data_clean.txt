According to PANews, network economist Timothy Peterson has issued a warning regarding the potential impact of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions on the broader market and Bitcoin. Peterson suggests that if the Federal Reserve delays interest rate cuts in 2025, it could lead to a wider market downturn, potentially pulling Bitcoin back to $70,000. His analysis model indicates that Bitcoin might bottom out at $57,000 in the next bear market. However, Peterson considers this scenario unlikely due to the high number of investors closely monitoring Bitcoin.

According to PANews, Michael Saylor, co-founder of Strategy, presented a comprehensive cryptocurrency strategy at the White House Digital Assets Summit. He suggested that by establishing a clear regulatory framework, removing barriers to innovation, and strategically acquiring Bitcoin, the United States could unlock up to $100 trillion in economic value over the next decade.Saylor categorized digital assets into four distinct groups: digital tokens for capital creation and innovation, digital securities for market efficiency, digital currencies for commerce and strengthening the global position of the U.S. dollar, and digital commodities like Bitcoin for wealth preservation. He argued that this classification would reduce regulatory uncertainty and seamlessly integrate digital assets into the traditional financial system. The proposal calls for lifting restrictions on cryptocurrencies, allowing U.S. entities to quickly access capital markets while ensuring the dollar remains essential in global trade.Additionally, Saylor's proposal emphasizes the need for fair disclosure and accountability to prevent fraud and conflicts of interest. It also advocates for ending "hostile and unfair tax policies" targeting the cryptocurrency industry. Instead, government support would enable the industry to "reach its full potential." Saylor urged the government to encourage and support major banks in the custody, trading, and financing of Bitcoin assets, stating that cryptocurrency industry participants should not be excluded from banking services.

Article Title: From GameFi to DeFi: Why BinaryX Rebranded to Four
In a recent interview with Binance News, the Four team, formerly known as BinaryX, discussed the reasons behind their rebranding and their renewed focus on becoming a leading launchpad within the BNB Chain ecosystem. The team also shared their ongoing commitment to advancing the GameFi sector and the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape.From GameFi Pioneer to Leading BNB Chain DeFi Launchpad“The journey began with the launch of CyberDragon in 2021, marking our entry into the GameFi space. We quickly expanded our offerings, introducing the BinaryX DAO and CyberArena in 2022, followed by CyberChess,” the team explained.BinaryX initially gained recognition in the GameFi space by creating engaging games and launching successful initial game offerings (IGOs). As the DeFi sector evolved, the team saw the need to expand its offerings. In 2024, the team took a significant step forward with the launch of Four.meme, a platform designed to support emerging projects in the memecoin space, and it quickly gained traction within the BNB Chain ecosystem. The introduction of the Alpha Boost Program and Telegram Bot also helped provide additional support to these projects. The most notable change came in February 2025 when BinaryX officially rebranded to Four. This rebranding was undertaken to better align with the team’s broader vision for the future of DeFi. Four is now dedicated to strengthening its position as a leading launchpad within the BNB Chain.“While BinaryX established a strong foundation in GameFi, Four represents our evolution into a comprehensive DeFi platform,” the team shared. “This change aligns our brand with our core values of innovation, resilience, and community empowerment.”$FORM as the Core of the Four EcosystemAlong with the new name, Four introduced a new token symbol—$FORM, replacing the previous $BNX. The token swap will occur on a 1:1 basis, ensuring a seamless transition for existing token holders. This move is part of Four’s broader strategy to create a unified brand identity and enhance the overall user experience. The $FORM token is a central pillar of the Four ecosystem. With a capped supply of 580 million tokens, the tokenomics model is designed to maintain scarcity and curb inflation. $FORM serves as a settlement unit, governance token, and utility token, allowing holders to participate in the Four DAO, where they can influence key decisions such as platform proposals and the distribution of dividends and airdrops.Furthermore, $FORM can be earned through active participation in token launches and games, fostering a sense of community and encouraging long-term engagement from token holders. To mitigate inflationary pressures and decentralize selling activity, Four utilizes Four.meme, games, and other applications to encourage developers to create high-quality DeFi products that incorporate $FORM.How Four Is Shaping the Future of DeFi with AI InnovationLooking ahead, the Four team envisions a future where DeFi is more accessible, innovative, and driven by the community. As the DeFi space matures, the team anticipates a shift toward more personalized user experiences and optimized risk management, driven by AI technology. The rise of decentralized scientific funding and collaboration is also expected to unlock new opportunities for research and innovation. “While the 2021 bull run showcased the potential of DeFi, the current phase is about realizing that potential through practical applications and long-term vision,” the team stated.Four is dedicated to supporting the development of AI-driven gaming projects. “We have established the Cyber Incubation Fund, which we use to support promising AI-driven game projects. We believe in fostering the growth of the AI gaming sector and encouraging more entrepreneurial teams like ours to innovate and develop cutting-edge solutions,” the team emphasized.Four and the Future of Memecoins on BNB ChainAs the incubator for Four.meme, the team views memecoins as a key part of the BNB Chain ecosystem. These assets are evolving beyond speculative vehicles to become powerful tools for community engagement, creativity, and introducing new users to DeFi.“The BNB Chain ecosystem provides a fertile ground for memecoins, with its low fees, fast transaction speeds, and vibrant community. We are committed to providing a platform that empowers the next generation of memecoin projects,” the team told Binance News.Read More Binance Will Support the BinaryX (BNX) Token Swap and Rebranding to Four (FORM)BNX Token Launches on Four.meme Platform With Multiple Trading PairsBinaryX Team Proposes Major Token Redistribution And Supply ReductionDisclaimerThis article includes third-party opinions and does not constitute financial advice.

Article Title: White House Official Discusses Bitcoin's Dominance And Cryptocurrency Policies
According to BlockBeats, a cryptocurrency analyst known as @goodalexander commented on the views of David Sacks, the White House's head of cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence. Sacks is noted for his Bitcoin maximalist tendencies, although he has not outlined a clear path for the U.S. to become a unique 'crypto capital.' However, he has emphasized avoiding judicial crackdowns and banking supply cuts. Sacks likened Bitcoin to a 'digital Fort Knox,' reinforcing its dominant position. His statements suggest that while the U.S. does not prioritize crypto projects for development, it plans to halt banking supply cuts and provide regulatory guidance. Discussions on taxation focus on a budget-neutral scenario, indicating a low likelihood of crypto tax exemptions. In the proposal for a digital asset reserve, Treasury Secretary Bessent effectively acts as an investment manager for seized crypto assets. When asked if budget-neutral Bitcoin acquisition implies selling existing reserve assets to invest in Bitcoin, Sacks acknowledged this possibility, which is seen as negative for altcoins but positive for Bitcoin. David Sacks emphasized conflict of interest prevention, detailing that he had liquidated all his crypto assets, including venture capital shares, before engaging in crypto affairs. He advocated for meme coins to disclose their lack of utility, similar to the operation mode of the Trump couple's NFT project, akin to a 'reverse securities registration.' Sacks highlighted Bitcoin's uniqueness: Satoshi's 'perfect birth,' fixed supply, decentralization, and a decade-long $2 trillion bug bounty mechanism—all supporting the store of value narrative, without addressing digital cash, internet of value, real-time payments, digital art, or DeFi. Sacks extensively discussed Bitcoin's uniqueness but did not address the fundamental reasons for U.S. crypto policy, such as payment infrastructure or optimizing Wall Street functions. Sometimes silence speaks volumes. When discussing digital assets beyond Bitcoin, Sacks stressed that founders should disclose holdings and unlocking terms. If claiming to be a Bitcoin alternative (e.g., fixed supply and decentralization), some form of assurance is required. This reinforces the narrative that other crypto assets are essentially store of value tools. In Sacks' view, the clear goal of crypto projects is to become Bitcoin alternatives—operating centrally in the short term but enjoying a transition period to become decentralized commodities. U.S. President Donald Trump's sons are deeply involved in non-Bitcoin crypto activities, openly claiming that Trump's policies will benefit altcoins, including retweeting 'ADA XRP SOL' and publicly supporting crypto tax exemptions. Sacks, however, stated that Trump's tweets mentioning ADA, XRP, and SOL 'have no deep meaning,' merely being 'top five market cap coins.' This contrasts sharply with Eric Trump's active promotion. A potential conflict seems to be brewing between David Sacks and Trump family members deeply invested in the crypto industry. The previous view that 'U.S. crypto projects have structural advantages' may be incorrect, but the current market situation is still better than under the Biden administration. In the long term, crypto market price increases do not require U.S. government endorsement; halting comprehensive prosecutions is already a positive, but the outcomes of this White House summit did not meet expectations.

Article Title: White House Rejects Cryptocurrency Transaction Tax Proposal
According to Cointelegraph, White House crypto and AI czar David Sacks has dismissed the notion of imposing taxes on each cryptocurrency transaction as a means to bolster the U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile. During a recent appearance on the All In podcast, host Jason Calacanis suggested a 0.01% tax on every cryptocurrency transaction, which would be denominated in the asset being transferred, bought, or sold. Sacks responded by expressing skepticism, noting that taxes often start modestly but can expand over time. He referenced the history of income tax in the United States, which initially applied to a small number of Americans but eventually broadened its reach. Sacks expressed concerns about the potential burden of new taxes, even if they are initially promised to have minimal impact. The proposal faced criticism from crypto investors, particularly due to the inclusion of taxes on transfers between wallets owned by the same individual. The recent White House Crypto Summit did not address specific tax policies, although the Trump administration has indicated support for comprehensive federal tax reform. U.S. President Donald Trump has previously proposed eliminating the federal income tax, suggesting that revenue could instead be generated through tariffs on imported goods. Trump pointed to the 19th century, when the U.S. government was funded solely by tariffs, as a period of significant prosperity. Howard Lutnick, the U.S. Commerce Secretary, echoed this proposal, suggesting the replacement of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with an 'External Revenue Service.' Research from accounting automation company Dancing Numbers indicates that the Trump administration's plan could potentially save each American taxpayer at least $134,809, with lifetime savings reaching up to $325,561 if state-income taxes are also repealed.

According to CoinDesk, Volatility Shares, an asset manager recognized for its innovative exchange-traded funds (ETFs), has submitted filings for three new XRP-focused products. These include a spot XRP ETF, a 2x leveraged XRP ETF, and an inverse -1x XRP ETF. The spot XRP ETF is intended to directly track the cryptocurrency's price, while the 2x leveraged ETF seeks to amplify daily price movements by a factor of two. Conversely, the inverse -1x ETF provides investors with an opportunity to bet against XRP’s price, mirroring the reverse of its daily performance. This development comes amid growing anticipation for regulatory approval of a spot XRP ETF. Traders on Polymarket are currently assessing a 77% probability that a spot XRP ETF will gain approval within this year. However, the likelihood of approval before July 31 is perceived to be lower, standing at 35%. Volatility Shares' filings position it alongside several other asset managers aiming to introduce XRP ETFs in the United States, including Grayscale, WisdomTree, Bitwise, 21Shares, CoinShares, and Canary Capital. In recent developments, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has initiated its review process for an XRP ETF filing by acknowledging a 19b-4 submission from the New York Stock Exchange and Grayscale. Meanwhile, the world's first spot XRP ETF is poised to launch in Brazil following approval from the country's securities regulator.

He argued that this classification would reduce regulatory uncertainty and seamlessly integrate digital assets into the traditional financial system. The proposal calls for lifting restrictions on cryptocurrencies, allowing U.S. entities to quickly access capital markets while ensuring the dollar remains essential in global trade.Additionally, Saylor's proposal emphasizes the need for fair disclosure and accountability to prevent fraud and conflicts of interest. It also advocates for ending "hostile and unfair tax policies" targeting the cryptocurrency industry. Instead, government support would enable the industry to "reach its full potential." Saylor urged the government to encourage and support major banks in the custody, trading, and financing of Bitcoin assets, stating that cryptocurrency industry participants should not be excluded from banking services.

Article Title: From GameFi to DeFi: Why BinaryX Rebranded to Four
In a recent interview with Binance News, the Four team, formerly known as BinaryX, discussed the reasons behind their rebranding and their renewed focus on becoming a leading launchpad within the BNB Chain ecosystem. The team also shared their ongoing commitment to advancing the GameFi sector and the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape.From GameFi Pioneer to Leading BNB Chain DeFi Launchpad“The journey began with the launch of CyberDragon in 2021, marking our entry into the GameFi space. We quickly expanded our offerings, introducing the BinaryX DAO and CyberArena in 2022, followed by CyberChess,” the team explained.BinaryX initially gained recognition in the GameFi space by creating engaging games and launching successful initial game offerings (IGOs). As the DeFi sector evolved, the team saw the need to expand its offerings. In 2024, the team took a significant step forward with the launch of Four.meme, a platform designed to support emerging projects in the memecoin space, and it quickly gained traction within the BNB Chain ecosystem. The introduction of the Alpha Boost Program and Telegram Bot also helped provide additional support to these projects. The most notable change came in February 2025 when BinaryX officially rebranded to Four. This rebranding was undertaken to better align with the team’s broader vision for the future of DeFi. Four is now dedicated to strengthening its position as a leading launchpad within the BNB Chain.“While BinaryX established a strong foundation in GameFi, Four represents our evolution into a comprehensive DeFi platform,” the team shared. “This change aligns our brand with our core values of innovation, resilience, and community empowerment.”$FORM as the Core of the Four EcosystemAlong with the new name, Four introduced a new token symbol—$FORM, replacing the previous $BNX. The token swap will occur on a 1:1 basis, ensuring a seamless transition for existing token holders. This move is part of Four’s broader strategy to create a unified brand identity and enhance the overall user experience. The $FORM token is a central pillar of the Four ecosystem. With a capped supply of 580 million tokens, the tokenomics model is designed to maintain scarcity and curb inflation. $FORM serves as a settlement unit, governance token, and utility token, allowing holders to participate in the Four DAO, where they can influence key decisions such as platform proposals and the distribution of dividends and airdrops.Furthermore, $FORM can be earned through active participation in token launches and games, fostering a sense of community and encouraging long-term engagement from token holders. To mitigate inflationary pressures and decentralize selling activity, Four utilizes Four.meme, games, and other applications to encourage developers to create high-quality DeFi products that incorporate $FORM.How Four Is Shaping the Future of DeFi with AI InnovationLooking ahead, the Four team envisions a future where DeFi is more accessible, innovative, and driven by the community. As the DeFi space matures, the team anticipates a shift toward more personalized user experiences and optimized risk management, driven by AI technology. The rise of decentralized scientific funding and collaboration is also expected to unlock new opportunities for research and innovation. “While the 2021 bull run showcased the potential of DeFi, the current phase is about realizing that potential through practical applications and long-term vision,” the team stated.Four is dedicated to supporting the development of AI-driven gaming projects. “We have established the Cyber Incubation Fund, which we use to support promising AI-driven game projects. We believe in fostering the growth of the AI gaming sector and encouraging more entrepreneurial teams like ours to innovate and develop cutting-edge solutions,” the team emphasized.Four and the Future of Memecoins on BNB ChainAs the incubator for Four.meme, the team views memecoins as a key part of the BNB Chain ecosystem. These assets are evolving beyond speculative vehicles to become powerful tools for community engagement, creativity, and introducing new users to DeFi.“The BNB Chain ecosystem provides a fertile ground for memecoins, with its low fees, fast transaction speeds, and vibrant community. We are committed to providing a platform that empowers the next generation of memecoin projects,” the team told Binance News.Read More Binance Will Support the BinaryX (BNX) Token Swap and Rebranding to Four (FORM)BNX Token Launches on Four.meme Platform With Multiple Trading PairsBinaryX Team Proposes Major Token Redistribution And Supply ReductionDisclaimerThis article includes third-party opinions and does not constitute financial advice.

Article Title: White House Official Discusses Bitcoin's Dominance And Cryptocurrency Policies
According to BlockBeats, a cryptocurrency analyst known as @goodalexander commented on the views of David Sacks, the White House's head of cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence. Sacks is noted for his Bitcoin maximalist tendencies, although he has not outlined a clear path for the U.S. to become a unique 'crypto capital.' However, he has emphasized avoiding judicial crackdowns and banking supply cuts. Sacks likened Bitcoin to a 'digital Fort Knox,' reinforcing its dominant position. His statements suggest that while the U.S. does not prioritize crypto projects for development, it plans to halt banking supply cuts and provide regulatory guidance. Discussions on taxation focus on a budget-neutral scenario, indicating a low likelihood of crypto tax exemptions. In the proposal for a digital asset reserve, Treasury Secretary Bessent effectively acts as an investment manager for seized crypto assets. When asked if budget-neutral Bitcoin acquisition implies selling existing reserve assets to invest in Bitcoin, Sacks acknowledged this possibility, which is seen as negative for altcoins but positive for Bitcoin. David Sacks emphasized conflict of interest prevention, detailing that he had liquidated all his crypto assets, including venture capital shares, before engaging in crypto affairs. He advocated for meme coins to disclose their lack of utility, similar to the operation mode of the Trump couple's NFT project, akin to a 'reverse securities registration.' Sacks highlighted Bitcoin's uniqueness: Satoshi's 'perfect birth,' fixed supply, decentralization, and a decade-long $2 trillion bug bounty mechanism—all supporting the store of value narrative, without addressing digital cash, internet of value, real-time payments, digital art, or DeFi. Sacks extensively discussed Bitcoin's uniqueness but did not address the fundamental reasons for U.S. crypto policy, such as payment infrastructure or optimizing Wall Street functions. Sometimes silence speaks volumes. When discussing digital assets beyond Bitcoin, Sacks stressed that founders should disclose holdings and unlocking terms. If claiming to be a Bitcoin alternative (e.g., fixed supply and decentralization), some form of assurance is required. This reinforces the narrative that other crypto assets are essentially store of value tools. In Sacks' view, the clear goal of crypto projects is to become Bitcoin alternatives—operating centrally in the short term but enjoying a transition period to become decentralized commodities. U.S. President Donald Trump's sons are deeply involved in non-Bitcoin crypto activities, openly claiming that Trump's policies will benefit altcoins, including retweeting 'ADA XRP SOL' and publicly supporting crypto tax exemptions. Sacks, however, stated that Trump's tweets mentioning ADA, XRP, and SOL 'have no deep meaning,' merely being 'top five market cap coins.' This contrasts sharply with Eric Trump's active promotion. A potential conflict seems to be brewing between David Sacks and Trump family members deeply invested in the crypto industry. The previous view that 'U.S. crypto projects have structural advantages' may be incorrect, but the current market situation is still better than under the Biden administration. In the long term, crypto market price increases do not require U.S. government endorsement; halting comprehensive prosecutions is already a positive, but the outcomes of this White House summit did not meet expectations.

Article Title: Volatility Shares Files For New XRP ETFs Amid Regulatory Hopes
According to CoinDesk, Volatility Shares, an asset manager recognized for its innovative exchange-traded funds (ETFs), has submitted filings for three new XRP-focused products. These include a spot XRP ETF, a 2x leveraged XRP ETF, and an inverse -1x XRP ETF. The spot XRP ETF is intended to directly track the cryptocurrency's price, while the 2x leveraged ETF seeks to amplify daily price movements by a factor of two. Conversely, the inverse -1x ETF provides investors with an opportunity to bet against XRP’s price, mirroring the reverse of its daily performance. This development comes amid growing anticipation for regulatory approval of a spot XRP ETF. Traders on Polymarket are currently assessing a 77% probability that a spot XRP ETF will gain approval within this year. However, the likelihood of approval before July 31 is perceived to be lower, standing at 35%. Volatility Shares' filings position it alongside several other asset managers aiming to introduce XRP ETFs in the United States, including Grayscale, WisdomTree, Bitwise, 21Shares, CoinShares, and Canary Capital. In recent developments, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has initiated its review process for an XRP ETF filing by acknowledging a 19b-4 submission from the New York Stock Exchange and Grayscale. Meanwhile, the world's first spot XRP ETF is poised to launch in Brazil following approval from the country's securities regulator. This marks a significant step in the global expansion of XRP ETFs, reflecting the increasing interest and potential for these financial products in various markets.

He suggested that by establishing a clear regulatory framework, removing barriers to innovation, and strategically acquiring Bitcoin, the United States could unlock up to $100 trillion in economic value over the next decade.Saylor categorized digital assets into four distinct groups: digital tokens for capital creation and innovation, digital securities for market efficiency, digital currencies for commerce and strengthening the global position of the U.S. dollar, and digital commodities like Bitcoin for wealth preservation. He argued that this classification would reduce regulatory uncertainty and seamlessly integrate digital assets into the traditional financial system. The proposal calls for lifting restrictions on cryptocurrencies, allowing U.S. entities to quickly access capital markets while ensuring the dollar remains essential in global trade.Additionally, Saylor's proposal emphasizes the need for fair disclosure and accountability to prevent fraud and conflicts of interest. It also advocates for ending "hostile and unfair tax policies" targeting the cryptocurrency industry. Instead, government support would enable the industry to "reach its full potential." Saylor urged the government to encourage and support major banks in the custody, trading, and financing of Bitcoin assets, stating that cryptocurrency industry participants should not be excluded from banking services.

Article Title: From GameFi to DeFi: Why BinaryX Rebranded to Four
In a recent interview with Binance News, the Four team, formerly known as BinaryX, discussed the reasons behind their rebranding and their renewed focus on becoming a leading launchpad within the BNB Chain ecosystem. The team also shared their ongoing commitment to advancing the GameFi sector and the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape.From GameFi Pioneer to Leading BNB Chain DeFi Launchpad“The journey began with the launch of CyberDragon in 2021, marking our entry into the GameFi space. We quickly expanded our offerings, introducing the BinaryX DAO and CyberArena in 2022, followed by CyberChess,” the team explained.BinaryX initially gained recognition in the GameFi space by creating engaging games and launching successful initial game offerings (IGOs). As the DeFi sector evolved, the team saw the need to expand its offerings. In 2024, the team took a significant step forward with the launch of Four.meme, a platform designed to support emerging projects in the memecoin space, and it quickly gained traction within the BNB Chain ecosystem. The introduction of the Alpha Boost Program and Telegram Bot also helped provide additional support to these projects. The most notable change came in February 2025 when BinaryX officially rebranded to Four. This rebranding was undertaken to better align with the team’s broader vision for the future of DeFi. Four is now dedicated to strengthening its position as a leading launchpad within the BNB Chain.“While BinaryX established a strong foundation in GameFi, Four represents our evolution into a comprehensive DeFi platform,” the team shared. “This change aligns our brand with our core values of innovation, resilience, and community empowerment.”$FORM as the Core of the Four EcosystemAlong with the new name, Four introduced a new token symbol—$FORM, replacing the previous $BNX. The token swap will occur on a 1:1 basis, ensuring a seamless transition for existing token holders. This move is part of Four’s broader strategy to create a unified brand identity and enhance the overall user experience. The $FORM token is a central pillar of the Four ecosystem. With a capped supply of 580 million tokens, the tokenomics model is designed to maintain scarcity and curb inflation. $FORM serves as a settlement unit, governance token, and utility token, allowing holders to participate in the Four DAO, where they can influence key decisions such as platform proposals and the distribution of dividends and airdrops.Furthermore, $FORM can be earned through active participation in token launches and games, fostering a sense of community and encouraging long-term engagement from token holders. To mitigate inflationary pressures and decentralize selling activity, Four utilizes Four.meme, games, and other applications to encourage developers to create high-quality DeFi products that incorporate $FORM.How Four Is Shaping the Future of DeFi with AI InnovationLooking ahead, the Four team envisions a future where DeFi is more accessible, innovative, and driven by the community. As the DeFi space matures, the team anticipates a shift toward more personalized user experiences and optimized risk management, driven by AI technology. The rise of decentralized scientific funding and collaboration is also expected to unlock new opportunities for research and innovation. “While the 2021 bull run showcased the potential of DeFi, the current phase is about realizing that potential through practical applications and long-term vision,” the team stated.Four is dedicated to supporting the development of AI-driven gaming projects. “We have established the Cyber Incubation Fund, which we use to support promising AI-driven game projects. We believe in fostering the growth of the AI gaming sector and encouraging more entrepreneurial teams like ours to innovate and develop cutting-edge solutions,” the team emphasized.Four and the Future of Memecoins on BNB ChainAs the incubator for Four.meme, the team views memecoins as a key part of the BNB Chain ecosystem. These assets are evolving beyond speculative vehicles to become powerful tools for community engagement, creativity, and introducing new users to DeFi.“The BNB Chain ecosystem provides a fertile ground for memecoins, with its low fees, fast transaction speeds, and vibrant community. We are committed to providing a platform that empowers the next generation of memecoin projects,” the team told Binance News.Read More Binance Will Support the BinaryX (BNX) Token Swap and Rebranding to Four (FORM)BNX Token Launches on Four.meme Platform With Multiple Trading PairsBinaryX Team Proposes Major Token Redistribution And Supply ReductionDisclaimerThis article includes third-party opinions and does not constitute financial advice.

Article Title: White House Official Discusses Bitcoin's Dominance And Cryptocurrency Policies
According to BlockBeats, a cryptocurrency analyst known as @goodalexander commented on the views of David Sacks, the White House's head of cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence. Sacks is noted for his Bitcoin maximalist tendencies, although he has not outlined a clear path for the U.S. to become a unique 'crypto capital.' However, he has emphasized avoiding judicial crackdowns and banking supply cuts. Sacks likened Bitcoin to a 'digital Fort Knox,' reinforcing its dominant position. His statements suggest that while the U.S. does not prioritize crypto projects for development, it plans to halt banking supply cuts and provide regulatory guidance. Discussions on taxation focus on a budget-neutral scenario, indicating a low likelihood of crypto tax exemptions. In the proposal for a digital asset reserve, Treasury Secretary Bessent effectively acts as an investment manager for seized crypto assets. When asked if budget-neutral Bitcoin acquisition implies selling existing reserve assets to invest in Bitcoin, Sacks acknowledged this possibility, which is seen as negative for altcoins but positive for Bitcoin. David Sacks emphasized conflict of interest prevention, detailing that he had liquidated all his crypto assets, including venture capital shares, before engaging in crypto affairs. He advocated for meme coins to disclose their lack of utility, similar to the operation mode of the Trump couple's NFT project, akin to a 'reverse securities registration.' Sacks highlighted Bitcoin's uniqueness: Satoshi's 'perfect birth,' fixed supply, decentralization, and a decade-long $2 trillion bug bounty mechanism—all supporting the store of value narrative, without addressing digital cash, internet of value, real-time payments, digital art, or DeFi. Sacks extensively discussed Bitcoin's uniqueness but did not address the fundamental reasons for U.S. crypto policy, such as payment infrastructure or optimizing Wall Street functions. Sometimes silence speaks volumes. When discussing digital assets beyond Bitcoin, Sacks stressed that founders should disclose holdings and unlocking terms. If claiming to be a Bitcoin alternative (e.g., fixed supply and decentralization), some form of assurance is required. This reinforces the narrative that other crypto assets are essentially store of value tools. In Sacks' view, the clear goal of crypto projects is to become Bitcoin alternatives—operating centrally in the short term but enjoying a transition period to become decentralized commodities. U.S. President Donald Trump's sons are deeply involved in non-Bitcoin crypto activities, openly claiming that Trump's policies will benefit altcoins, including retweeting 'ADA XRP SOL' and publicly supporting crypto tax exemptions. Sacks, however, stated that Trump's tweets mentioning ADA, XRP, and SOL 'have no deep meaning,' merely being 'top five market cap coins.' This contrasts sharply with Eric Trump's active promotion. A potential conflict seems to be brewing between David Sacks and Trump family members deeply invested in the crypto industry. The previous view that 'U.S. crypto projects have structural advantages' may be incorrect, but the current market situation is still better than under the Biden administration. In the long term, crypto market price increases do not require U.S. government endorsement; halting comprehensive prosecutions is already a positive, but the outcomes of this White House summit did not meet expectations.
