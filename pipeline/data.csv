Ethereum's Pectra Upgrade Poised To Influence 2025 Crypto Market,"Cointelegraph, Ethereum's much-anticipated Pectra upgrade is expected to play a pivotal role in shaping the next phase of the 2025 cryptocurrency market cycle. Despite Ether's recent underperformance compared to Bitcoin, analysts remain optimistic about its future prospects. The price of Ether (ETH) experienced a significant decline of over 32% in February, reaching a local low of $2,073 before rebounding to its current value of $2,245, as per Cointelegraph Markets Pro data. The Pectra upgrade, set for March 5, is anticipated to alleviate long-term selling pressure, according to Gabriel Halm, a research analyst at blockchain intelligence firm IntoTheBlock. Halm noted that while the upgrade may not immediately boost prices, it represents a crucial advancement in the ongoing enhancements to the Ethereum ecosystem. By reducing consensus overhead and enhancing Layer 2 scalability, the upgrade is expected to increase the network's overall capacity, thereby strengthening its competitive position. Furthermore, Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-7251 will raise the validator staking limit from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, facilitating easier compounding of earnings for validators and potentially reducing sell pressure over time. The substantial monthly correction in Ether's price may indicate a setup for the next upward movement, based on fractal patterns from the 2017 cycle, as shared by popular crypto trader Merlijn The Trader in a recent post. In the realm of crypto trading, technical traders utilize price fractal patterns to identify key support and resistance levels and potential trend reversals based on historical data. In parallel with these developments, the Ethereum Foundation has announced a leadership restructuring in response to criticism from community members who argue that the network is losing direction due to competition from high-throughput chains and layer-2 solutions. The Foundation introduced a new leadership structure with two co-directors: Hsiao-Wei Wang, a core researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, and Tomasz Stańczak, CEO of Nethermind, one of the largest execution clients on Ethereum. Wang and Stańczak will assume their roles on March 17, bringing extensive experience and leadership to the Foundation. This leadership change occurs amid growing concerns that layer-2 scaling solutions are cannibalizing Ethereum, and competition from emerging high-throughput chains is eroding investor confidence. To address these issues, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin outlined a strategy in a January blog post, which includes increasing the blob count to enhance transaction capacity and encouraging layer-2 solutions to contribute a portion of their fees to the base layer.

"Bitcoin Active Addresses Surge, Indicating Potential Market Shift","Cointelegraph, Bitcoin's active addresses have reached a near three-month high, suggesting a possible market capitulation that could lead to a price reversal following the recent correction. Data from Glassnode reveals that active addresses on the Bitcoin network surged to over 912,300 on February 28, a level not observed since December 16, 2024, when Bitcoin was valued at approximately $105,000. The increase in active addresses may indicate a 'capitulation moment' for the cryptocurrency market, as noted by the crypto intelligence platform IntoTheBlock. The firm highlighted in a February 28 post that historically, spikes in on-chain activity have often aligned with market peaks and bottoms, driven by panic sellers exiting and opportunistic buyers entering the market. While no single metric can guarantee a price reversal, this surge suggests the market could be at a critical turning point. In financial markets, capitulation refers to investors selling their positions in panic, leading to a significant price decline and signaling an imminent market bottom before the start of the next uptrend. Bitcoin's ability to maintain a position above the $80,500 mark is crucial to avoid further losses. Stella Zlatareva, dispatch editor at digital asset investment platform Nexo, emphasized that Bitcoin's ability to reclaim $80,500 will be a key factor in determining near-term momentum. A breakout above this level could pave the way for further upside, while failing to establish it as support may lead to further testing on the downside. Bitcoin may revisit this crucial support if its price falls below $84,000. A potential correction below $84,000 could trigger over $1 billion worth of leveraged long liquidations across all exchanges, according to CoinGlass data. Despite short-term volatility, Bitcoin's price is closer to forming a market bottom than reaching a local top, as indicated by Bitcoin's market value to realized value (MVRV) Z-score. This technical indicator is used to determine whether an asset is overbought or oversold. On March 1, Bitcoin's MVRV Z-score stood at 2.01, signaling that Bitcoin's price is approaching the green territory at the bottom of the chart, becoming increasingly oversold, according to Glassnode data.

"Bitcoin Active Addresses Surge, Indicating Potential Market Shift","Cointelegraph, Bitcoin's active addresses have reached a near three-month high, suggesting a possible market capitulation that could lead to a price reversal following the recent correction. Data from Glassnode reveals that active addresses on the Bitcoin network surged to over 912,300 on February 28, a level not observed since December 16, 2024, when Bitcoin was valued at approximately $105,000. The increase in active addresses may indicate a 'capitulation moment' for the cryptocurrency market, as noted by the crypto intelligence platform IntoTheBlock. The firm highlighted in a February 28 post that historically, spikes in on-chain activity have often aligned with market peaks and bottoms, driven by panic sellers exiting and opportunistic buyers entering the market. While no single metric can guarantee a price reversal, this surge suggests the market could be at a critical turning point. In financial markets, capitulation refers to investors selling their positions in panic, leading to a significant price decline and signaling an imminent market bottom before the start of the next uptrend. Bitcoin's ability to maintain a position above the $80,500 mark is crucial to avoid further losses. Stella Zlatareva, dispatch editor at digital asset investment platform Nexo, emphasized that Bitcoin's ability to reclaim $80,500 will be a key factor in determining near-term momentum. A breakout above this level could pave the way for further upside, while failing to establish it as support may lead to further testing on the downside. Bitcoin may revisit this crucial support if its price falls below $84,000. A potential correction below $84,000 could trigger over $1 billion worth of leveraged long liquidations across all exchanges, according to CoinGlass data. Despite short-term volatility, Bitcoin's price is closer to forming a market bottom than reaching a local top, as indicated by Bitcoin's market value to realized value (MVRV) Z-score. This technical indicator is used to determine whether an asset is overbought or oversold. On March 1, Bitcoin's MVRV Z-score stood at 2.01, signaling that Bitcoin's price is approaching the green territory at the bottom of the chart, becoming increasingly oversold, according to Glassnode data.

Ethereum Researcher Proposes Solution to Address Centralization and Eliminate MEV,"Cointelegraph, a new proposal has been introduced by an Ethereum researcher, aiming to decentralize the current block building process on the Ethereum network. The proposal, named 'Decentralized Random Block Proposal,' seeks to implement a shared random algorithm to democratize block proposing and eliminate Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) at the block level. This approach leverages Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) to potentially accelerate the propagation of transactions to network validators, as explained by the pseudonymous researcher Malik672 in a recent post.Malik672 highlighted that while Ethereum's proof-of-stake model and the proposer-builder separation feature have somewhat reduced the concentration of MEV, they have also led to increased centralization among builders and relays. Ethereum Foundation researcher Toni Wahrstätter noted that two block builders, Beaverbuild and Titan Builder, were responsible for constructing 88.7% of all Ethereum blocks in the first half of October. Although this figure has decreased to around 80%, it remains higher than desired by the Ethereum community.The proposed system aims to distribute block building across thousands of clients globally, thereby fully democratizing the process and preventing any single entity from dominating. Unlike the current Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS) method, which relies on a centralized builder pool, the new system uses BFT to mitigate mempool variance and ensure robustness. MEV, which involves profit-driven manipulation strategies like arbitrage and front-running, has been a concern for ordinary network users, as it undermines Ethereum's decentralized ethos.Under Malik672's proposal, all Ethereum clients would construct blocks using a cryptographically random algorithm, preventing the manipulation tactics that currently impact users. This solution aligns with Ethereum's trustless roots and remains compatible with Danksharding's blob requirements, a solution aimed at scaling Ethereum layer 2s. Additionally, the proposal could potentially reduce slot times from 12 seconds to approximately 6 to 8 seconds.This development comes as Ethereum developers and researchers have agreed to deploy upgrades at a faster pace, as announced on February 13, to accelerate Ethereum's technical roadmap. The ongoing efforts to enhance Ethereum's infrastructure reflect the community's commitment to maintaining its decentralized nature while improving efficiency and scalability.

Ethereum Foundation Announces New Leadership Amid Community Debate,"CoinDesk, the Ethereum Foundation (EF), a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the development and research of the Ethereum blockchain, has appointed Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz Stańczak as its new co-executive directors. This announcement was made in a blog post on Saturday, following the recent news of Aya Miyaguchi stepping down from her role as executive director to become the EF's new president. The leadership changes come amid ongoing discussions within the community regarding the EF's influence in the ecosystem. Some community members have criticized the organization and its leadership for the underperformance of Ethereum's token, ether (ETH), compared to other cryptocurrencies. Additionally, Ethereum has seen a decline in attracting new developers, with its competitor Solana surpassing it for the first time. Wang has been with the Ethereum Foundation since 2017, contributing to research on key concepts such as sharding and playing a significant role in Ethereum's major transition known as ""the Merge."" Stańczak, on the other hand, is the founder of Nethermind, one of the largest software clients operating on the Ethereum blockchain. The Foundation emphasized in their blog post that the Ethereum ecosystem faces the challenge of transitioning from an early-stage project catering to a small group of enthusiasts to becoming a robust, permissionless, and censorship-resistant base layer for global finance and software. Further changes within the Ethereum community include former EF researcher Danny Ryan joining Etherealize, a new initiative aimed at integrating Ethereum with Wall Street. Etherealize was founded by ex-banker Vivek Raman, who previously stated that the project's goal is to bridge the gap between Ethereum and financial institutions by educating them and promoting ETH as a credible crypto asset. In a post shared on X, Ryan expressed his intention to ""build a new Ethereum institution with Real World Ethereum as its north star,"" highlighting the readiness of the world to embrace blockchain technology and the commitment to undertake the necessary efforts to facilitate this transition.

Swiss National Bank Rejects Bitcoin Reserves Proposal,"CoinDesk, Swiss National Bank (SNB) President Martin Schlegel has dismissed the idea of incorporating bitcoin into Switzerland's central bank reserves. Schlegel highlighted concerns over the cryptocurrency's volatility, liquidity, and security as primary reasons for this decision. In an interview with the Tamedia group, he emphasized that the instability of cryptocurrencies makes them unsuitable for preserving long-term value. Schlegel further explained that the central bank's reserves must remain highly liquid to be readily available for monetary policy interventions. He also pointed out the inherent security risks associated with software-based assets, noting that software can be prone to bugs and vulnerabilities. These remarks come amid a broader discussion in Switzerland regarding the potential inclusion of bitcoin in the SNB's reserves. A recent initiative, spearheaded by entrepreneur Yves Bennaim, is advocating for a constitutional amendment that would require the SNB to hold bitcoin alongside gold in its reserves. This initiative, launched in December, aims to gather 100,000 signatures within 18 months to prompt a nationwide vote on the matter. While the proposal does not specify the exact bitcoin allocations, it suggests that the reserves should be built from the bank's earnings. Despite the increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in Switzerland, with several Swiss banks offering cryptocurrency-related services, Schlegel remains skeptical. He described cryptocurrencies as a ""niche phenomenon"" and expressed confidence in the Swiss franc's continued strength. Schlegel stated that the SNB is ""not afraid of competition from cryptocurrencies,"" underscoring the enduring stability of traditional currencies.

Vitalik Buterin Supports Roger Ver Amid Legal Battle,"Cointelegraph, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has expressed support for early crypto investor and entrepreneur Roger Ver, who is embroiled in a legal dispute with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) over alleged tax evasion. Ver is facing potential extradition to the US. Buterin echoed Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht's call for the charges against Ver to be dropped, describing the case as ""absurd"" and ""politically motivated."" He criticized the US tax-by-citizenship and exit tax policies, noting that they are more stringent than those of most other countries. Buterin also condemned any alleged intimidation tactics by the IRS to obtain privileged information from Ver's legal team. Ver's legal troubles have sparked broader discussions about tax reform in the United States, with some lawmakers and citizens advocating for the abolition of the income tax and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The DOJ announced tax evasion charges against Ver on April 30, 2024, leading to his arrest in Spain, where he was detained for several weeks. Ver was released on bail after posting $163,000, under the condition that he remain in Spain, surrender his passport, and report to court officials regularly. In a legal filing dated December 3, 2024, Ver's attorneys argued that the charges were unconstitutional and sought their dismissal. They criticized the exit tax law for US citizens with substantial investable assets, claiming it was vague and violated constitutional clauses. The case has drawn criticism from crypto investors, who accuse the DOJ of targeting Ver as part of the Biden administration's perceived anti-crypto agenda. Ver himself asserts that the prosecution is a result of his crypto advocacy rather than any tax-related offenses.
