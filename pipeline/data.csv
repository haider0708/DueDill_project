Bitcoin's Potential Decline Amid Federal Reserve Rate Decisions,"PANews, network economist Timothy Peterson has issued a warning regarding the potential impact of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions on the broader market and Bitcoin. Peterson suggests that if the Federal Reserve delays interest rate cuts in 2025, it could lead to a wider market downturn, potentially pulling Bitcoin back to $70,000. His analysis model indicates that Bitcoin might bottom out at $57,000 in the next bear market. However, Peterson considers this scenario unlikely due to the high number of investors closely monitoring Bitcoin.

Michael Saylor Proposes Comprehensive Cryptocurrency Strategy,"PANews, Michael Saylor, co-founder of Strategy, presented a comprehensive cryptocurrency strategy at the White House Digital Assets Summit. He suggested that by establishing a clear regulatory framework, removing barriers to innovation, and strategically acquiring Bitcoin, the United States could unlock up to $100 trillion in economic value over the next decade.Saylor categorized digital assets into four distinct groups: digital tokens for capital creation and innovation, digital securities for market efficiency, digital currencies for commerce and strengthening the global position of the U.S. dollar, and digital commodities like Bitcoin for wealth preservation. He argued that this classification would reduce regulatory uncertainty and seamlessly integrate digital assets into the traditional financial system. The proposal calls for lifting restrictions on cryptocurrencies, allowing U.S. entities to quickly access capital markets while ensuring the dollar remains essential in global trade.Additionally, Saylor's proposal emphasizes the need for fair disclosure and accountability to prevent fraud and conflicts of interest. It also advocates for ending ""hostile and unfair tax policies"" targeting the cryptocurrency industry. Instead, government support would enable the industry to ""reach its full potential."" Saylor urged the government to encourage and support major banks in the custody, trading, and financing of Bitcoin assets, stating that cryptocurrency industry participants should not be excluded from banking services.

White House Official Discusses Bitcoin's Dominance And Cryptocurrency Policies,"BlockBeats, a cryptocurrency analyst known as @goodalexander commented on the views of David Sacks, the White House's head of cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence. Sacks is noted for his Bitcoin maximalist tendencies, although he has not outlined a clear path for the U.S. to become a unique 'crypto capital.' However, he has emphasized avoiding judicial crackdowns and banking supply cuts. Sacks likened Bitcoin to a 'digital Fort Knox,' reinforcing its dominant position. His statements suggest that while the U.S. does not prioritize crypto projects for development, it plans to halt banking supply cuts and provide regulatory guidance. Discussions on taxation focus on a budget-neutral scenario, indicating a low likelihood of crypto tax exemptions. In the proposal for a digital asset reserve, Treasury Secretary Bessent effectively acts as an investment manager for seized crypto assets. When asked if budget-neutral Bitcoin acquisition implies selling existing reserve assets to invest in Bitcoin, Sacks acknowledged this possibility, which is seen as negative for altcoins but positive for Bitcoin. David Sacks emphasized conflict of interest prevention, detailing that he had liquidated all his crypto assets, including venture capital shares, before engaging in crypto affairs. He advocated for meme coins to disclose their lack of utility, similar to the operation mode of the Trump couple's NFT project, akin to a 'reverse securities registration.' Sacks highlighted Bitcoin's uniqueness: Satoshi's 'perfect birth,' fixed supply, decentralization, and a decade-long $2 trillion bug bounty mechanism—all supporting the store of value narrative, without addressing digital cash, internet of value, real-time payments, digital art, or DeFi. Sacks extensively discussed Bitcoin's uniqueness but did not address the fundamental reasons for U.S. crypto policy, such as payment infrastructure or optimizing Wall Street functions. Sometimes silence speaks volumes. When discussing digital assets beyond Bitcoin, Sacks stressed that founders should disclose holdings and unlocking terms. If claiming to be a Bitcoin alternative (e.g., fixed supply and decentralization), some form of assurance is required. This reinforces the narrative that other crypto assets are essentially store of value tools. In Sacks' view, the clear goal of crypto projects is to become Bitcoin alternatives—operating centrally in the short term but enjoying a transition period to become decentralized commodities. U.S. President Donald Trump's sons are deeply involved in non-Bitcoin crypto activities, openly claiming that Trump's policies will benefit altcoins, including retweeting 'ADA XRP SOL' and publicly supporting crypto tax exemptions. Sacks, however, stated that Trump's tweets mentioning ADA, XRP, and SOL 'have no deep meaning,' merely being 'top five market cap coins.' This contrasts sharply with Eric Trump's active promotion. A potential conflict seems to be brewing between David Sacks and Trump family members deeply invested in the crypto industry. The previous view that 'U.S. crypto projects have structural advantages' may be incorrect, but the current market situation is still better than under the Biden administration. In the long term, crypto market price increases do not require U.S. government endorsement; halting comprehensive prosecutions is already a positive, but the outcomes of this White House summit did not meet expectations.

White House Rejects Cryptocurrency Transaction Tax Proposal,"Cointelegraph, White House crypto and AI czar David Sacks has dismissed the notion of imposing taxes on each cryptocurrency transaction as a means to bolster the U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile. During a recent appearance on the All In podcast, host Jason Calacanis suggested a 0.01% tax on every cryptocurrency transaction, which would be denominated in the asset being transferred, bought, or sold. Sacks responded by expressing skepticism, noting that taxes often start modestly but can expand over time. He referenced the history of income tax in the United States, which initially applied to a small number of Americans but eventually broadened its reach. Sacks expressed concerns about the potential burden of new taxes, even if they are initially promised to have minimal impact. The proposal faced criticism from crypto investors, particularly due to the inclusion of taxes on transfers between wallets owned by the same individual. The recent White House Crypto Summit did not address specific tax policies, although the Trump administration has indicated support for comprehensive federal tax reform. U.S. President Donald Trump has previously proposed eliminating the federal income tax, suggesting that revenue could instead be generated through tariffs on imported goods. Trump pointed to the 19th century, when the U.S. government was funded solely by tariffs, as a period of significant prosperity. Howard Lutnick, the U.S. Commerce Secretary, echoed this proposal, suggesting the replacement of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with an 'External Revenue Service.' Research from accounting automation company Dancing Numbers indicates that the Trump administration's plan could potentially save each American taxpayer at least $134,809, with lifetime savings reaching up to $325,561 if state-income taxes are also repealed.

Volatility Shares Files For New XRP ETFs Amid Regulatory Hopes,"CoinDesk, Volatility Shares, an asset manager recognized for its innovative exchange-traded funds (ETFs), has submitted filings for three new XRP-focused products. These include a spot XRP ETF, a 2x leveraged XRP ETF, and an inverse -1x XRP ETF. The spot XRP ETF is intended to directly track the cryptocurrency's price, while the 2x leveraged ETF seeks to amplify daily price movements by a factor of two. Conversely, the inverse -1x ETF provides investors with an opportunity to bet against XRP’s price, mirroring the reverse of its daily performance. This development comes amid growing anticipation for regulatory approval of a spot XRP ETF. Traders on Polymarket are currently assessing a 77% probability that a spot XRP ETF will gain approval within this year. However, the likelihood of approval before July 31 is perceived to be lower, standing at 35%. Volatility Shares' filings position it alongside several other asset managers aiming to introduce XRP ETFs in the United States, including Grayscale, WisdomTree, Bitwise, 21Shares, CoinShares, and Canary Capital. In recent developments, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has initiated its review process for an XRP ETF filing by acknowledging a 19b-4 submission from the New York Stock Exchange and Grayscale. Meanwhile, the world's first spot XRP ETF is poised to launch in Brazil following approval from the country's securities regulator. This marks a significant step in the global expansion of XRP ETFs, reflecting the increasing interest and potential for these financial products in various markets.

He suggested that by establishing a clear regulatory framework, removing barriers to innovation, and strategically acquiring Bitcoin, the United States could unlock up to $100 trillion in economic value over the next decade.Saylor categorized digital assets into four distinct groups: digital tokens for capital creation and innovation, digital securities for market efficiency, digital currencies for commerce and strengthening the global position of the U.S. dollar, and digital commodities like Bitcoin for wealth preservation. He argued that this classification would reduce regulatory uncertainty and seamlessly integrate digital assets into the traditional financial system. The proposal calls for lifting restrictions on cryptocurrencies, allowing U.S. entities to quickly access capital markets while ensuring the dollar remains essential in global trade.Additionally, Saylor's proposal emphasizes the need for fair disclosure and accountability to prevent fraud and conflicts of interest. It also advocates for ending ""hostile and unfair tax policies"" targeting the cryptocurrency industry. Instead, government support would enable the industry to ""reach its full potential."" Saylor urged the government to encourage and support major banks in the custody, trading, and financing of Bitcoin assets, stating that cryptocurrency industry participants should not be excluded from banking services.

Bitcoin's Potential Decline Amid Federal Reserve Rate Decisions,"PANews, network economist Timothy Peterson has issued a warning regarding the potential impact of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions on the broader market and Bitcoin. Peterson suggests that if the Federal Reserve delays interest rate cuts in 2025, it could lead to a wider market downturn, potentially pulling Bitcoin back to $70,000. His analysis model indicates that Bitcoin might bottom out at $57,000 in the next bear market. However, Peterson considers this scenario unlikely due to the high number of investors closely monitoring Bitcoin.

White House Official Discusses Bitcoin's Dominance And Cryptocurrency Policies,"BlockBeats, a cryptocurrency analyst known as @goodalexander commented on the views of David Sacks, the White House's head of cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence. Sacks is noted for his Bitcoin maximalist tendencies, although he has not outlined a clear path for the U.S. to become a unique 'crypto capital.' However, he has emphasized avoiding judicial crackdowns and banking supply cuts. Sacks likened Bitcoin to a 'digital Fort Knox,' reinforcing its dominant position. His statements suggest that while the U.S. does not prioritize crypto projects for development, it plans to halt banking supply cuts and provide regulatory guidance. Discussions on taxation focus on a budget-neutral scenario, indicating a low likelihood of crypto tax exemptions. In the proposal for a digital asset reserve, Treasury Secretary Bessent effectively acts as an investment manager for seized crypto assets. When asked if budget-neutral Bitcoin acquisition implies selling existing reserve assets to invest in Bitcoin, Sacks acknowledged this possibility, which is seen as negative for altcoins but positive for Bitcoin. David Sacks emphasized conflict of interest prevention, detailing that he had liquidated all his crypto assets, including venture capital shares, before engaging in crypto affairs. He advocated for meme coins to disclose their lack of utility, similar to the operation mode of the Trump couple's NFT project, akin to a 'reverse securities registration.' Sacks highlighted Bitcoin's uniqueness: Satoshi's 'perfect birth,' fixed supply, decentralization, and a decade-long $2 trillion bug bounty mechanism—all supporting the store of value narrative, without addressing digital cash, internet of value, real-time payments, digital art, or DeFi. Sacks extensively discussed Bitcoin's uniqueness but did not address the fundamental reasons for U.S. crypto policy, such as payment infrastructure or optimizing Wall Street functions. Sometimes silence speaks volumes. When discussing digital assets beyond Bitcoin, Sacks stressed that founders should disclose holdings and unlocking terms. If claiming to be a Bitcoin alternative (e.g., fixed supply and decentralization), some form of assurance is required. This reinforces the narrative that other crypto assets are essentially store of value tools. In Sacks' view, the clear goal of crypto projects is to become Bitcoin alternatives—operating centrally in the short term but enjoying a transition period to become decentralized commodities. U.S. President Donald Trump's sons are deeply involved in non-Bitcoin crypto activities, openly claiming that Trump's policies will benefit altcoins, including retweeting 'ADA XRP SOL' and publicly supporting crypto tax exemptions. Sacks, however, stated that Trump's tweets mentioning ADA, XRP, and SOL 'have no deep meaning,' merely being 'top five market cap coins.' This contrasts sharply with Eric Trump's active promotion. A potential conflict seems to be brewing between David Sacks and Trump family members deeply invested in the crypto industry. The previous view that 'U.S. crypto projects have structural advantages' may be incorrect, but the current market situation is still better than under the Biden administration. In the long term, crypto market price increases do not require U.S. government endorsement; halting comprehensive prosecutions is already a positive, but the outcomes of this White House summit did not meet expectations.

Volatility Shares Files For New XRP ETFs Amid Regulatory Hopes,"CoinDesk, Volatility Shares, an asset manager recognized for its innovative exchange-traded funds (ETFs), has submitted filings for three new XRP-focused products. These include a spot XRP ETF, a 2x leveraged XRP ETF, and an inverse -1x XRP ETF. The spot XRP ETF is intended to directly track the cryptocurrency's price, while the 2x leveraged ETF seeks to amplify daily price movements by a factor of two. Conversely, the inverse -1x ETF provides investors with an opportunity to bet against XRP’s price, mirroring the reverse of its daily performance. This development comes amid growing anticipation for regulatory approval of a spot XRP ETF. Traders on Polymarket are currently assessing a 77% probability that a spot XRP ETF will gain approval within this year. However, the likelihood of approval before July 31 is perceived to be lower, standing at 35%. Volatility Shares' filings position it alongside several other asset managers aiming to introduce XRP ETFs in the United States, including Grayscale, WisdomTree, Bitwise, 21Shares, CoinShares, and Canary Capital. In recent developments, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has initiated its review process for an XRP ETF filing by acknowledging a 19b-4 submission from the New York Stock Exchange and Grayscale. Meanwhile, the world's first spot XRP ETF is poised to launch in Brazil following approval from the country's securities regulator. This marks a significant step in the global expansion of XRP ETFs, reflecting the increasing interest and potential for these financial products in various markets.

Bitcoin's Potential Decline Amid Federal Reserve Rate Decisions,"PANews, network economist Timothy Peterson has issued a warning regarding the potential impact of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions on the broader market and Bitcoin. Peterson suggests that if the Federal Reserve delays interest rate cuts in 2025, it could lead to a wider market downturn, potentially pulling Bitcoin back to $70,000. His analysis model indicates that Bitcoin might bottom out at $57,000 in the next bear market. However, Peterson considers this scenario unlikely due to the high number of investors closely monitoring Bitcoin.

Michael Saylor Proposes Comprehensive Cryptocurrency Strategy,"PANews, Michael Saylor, co-founder of Strategy, presented a comprehensive cryptocurrency strategy at the White House Digital Assets Summit. He suggested that by establishing a clear regulatory framework, removing barriers to innovation, and strategically acquiring Bitcoin, the United States could unlock up to $100 trillion in economic value over the next decade.Saylor categorized digital assets into four distinct groups: digital tokens for capital creation and innovation, digital securities for market efficiency, digital currencies for commerce and strengthening the global position of the U.S. dollar, and digital commodities like Bitcoin for wealth preservation. He argued that this classification would reduce regulatory uncertainty and seamlessly integrate digital assets into the traditional financial system. The proposal calls for lifting restrictions on cryptocurrencies, allowing U.S. entities to quickly access capital markets while ensuring the dollar remains essential in global trade.Additionally, Saylor's proposal emphasizes the need for fair disclosure and accountability to prevent fraud and conflicts of interest. It also advocates for ending ""hostile and unfair tax policies"" targeting the cryptocurrency industry. Instead, government support would enable the industry to ""reach its full potential."" Saylor urged the government to encourage and support major banks in the custody, trading, and financing of Bitcoin assets, stating that cryptocurrency industry participants should not be excluded from banking services.

White House Official Discusses Bitcoin's Dominance And Cryptocurrency Policies,"BlockBeats, a cryptocurrency analyst known as @goodalexander commented on the views of David Sacks, the White House's head of cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence. Sacks is noted for his Bitcoin maximalist tendencies, although he has not outlined a clear path for the U.S. to become a unique 'crypto capital.' However, he has emphasized avoiding judicial crackdowns and banking supply cuts. Sacks likened Bitcoin to a 'digital Fort Knox,' reinforcing its dominant position. His statements suggest that while the U.S. does not prioritize crypto projects for development, it plans to halt banking supply cuts and provide regulatory guidance. Discussions on taxation focus on a budget-neutral scenario, indicating a low likelihood of crypto tax exemptions. In the proposal for a digital asset reserve, Treasury Secretary Bessent effectively acts as an investment manager for seized crypto assets. When asked if budget-neutral Bitcoin acquisition implies selling existing reserve assets to invest in Bitcoin, Sacks acknowledged this possibility, which is seen as negative for altcoins but positive for Bitcoin. David Sacks emphasized conflict of interest prevention, detailing that he had liquidated all his crypto assets, including venture capital shares, before engaging in crypto affairs. He advocated for meme coins to disclose their lack of utility, similar to the operation mode of the Trump couple's NFT project, akin to a 'reverse securities registration.' Sacks highlighted Bitcoin's uniqueness: Satoshi's 'perfect birth,' fixed supply, decentralization, and a decade-long $2 trillion bug bounty mechanism—all supporting the store of value narrative, without addressing digital cash, internet of value, real-time payments, digital art, or DeFi. Sacks extensively discussed Bitcoin's uniqueness but did not address the fundamental reasons for U.S. crypto policy, such as payment infrastructure or optimizing Wall Street functions. Sometimes silence speaks volumes. When discussing digital assets beyond Bitcoin, Sacks stressed that founders should disclose holdings and unlocking terms. If claiming to be a Bitcoin alternative (e.g., fixed supply and decentralization), some form of assurance is required. This reinforces the narrative that other crypto assets are essentially store of value tools. In Sacks' view, the clear goal of crypto projects is to become Bitcoin alternatives—operating centrally in the short term but enjoying a transition period to become decentralized commodities. U.S. President Donald Trump's sons are deeply involved in non-Bitcoin crypto activities, openly claiming that Trump's policies will benefit altcoins, including retweeting 'ADA XRP SOL' and publicly supporting crypto tax exemptions. Sacks, however, stated that Trump's tweets mentioning ADA, XRP, and SOL 'have no deep meaning,' merely being 'top five market cap coins.' This contrasts sharply with Eric Trump's active promotion. A potential conflict seems to be brewing between David Sacks and Trump family members deeply invested in the crypto industry. The previous view that 'U.S. crypto projects have structural advantages' may be incorrect, but the current market situation is still better than under the Biden administration. In the long term, crypto market price increases do not require U.S. government endorsement; halting comprehensive prosecutions is already a positive, but the outcomes of this White House summit did not meet expectations.

Volatility Shares Files For New XRP ETFs Amid Regulatory Hopes,"CoinDesk, Volatility Shares, an asset manager recognized for its innovative exchange-traded funds (ETFs), has submitted filings for three new XRP-focused products. These include a spot XRP ETF, a 2x leveraged XRP ETF, and an inverse -1x XRP ETF. The spot XRP ETF is intended to directly track the cryptocurrency's price, while the 2x leveraged ETF seeks to amplify daily price movements by a factor of two. Conversely, the inverse -1x ETF provides investors with an opportunity to bet against XRP’s price, mirroring the reverse of its daily performance. This development comes amid growing anticipation for regulatory approval of a spot XRP ETF. Traders on Polymarket are currently assessing a 77% probability that a spot XRP ETF will gain approval within this year. However, the likelihood of approval before July 31 is perceived to be lower, standing at 35%. Volatility Shares' filings position it alongside several other asset managers aiming to introduce XRP ETFs in the United States, including Grayscale, WisdomTree, Bitwise, 21Shares, CoinShares, and Canary Capital. In recent developments, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has initiated its review process for an XRP ETF filing by acknowledging a 19b-4 submission from the New York Stock Exchange and Grayscale.

Volatility Shares Files For New XRP ETFs Amid Regulatory Hopes,"CoinDesk, Volatility Shares, an asset manager recognized for its innovative exchange-traded funds (ETFs), has submitted filings for three new XRP-focused products. These include a spot XRP ETF, a 2x leveraged XRP ETF, and an inverse -1x XRP ETF. The spot XRP ETF is intended to directly track the cryptocurrency's price, while the 2x leveraged ETF seeks to amplify daily price movements by a factor of two. Conversely, the inverse -1x ETF provides investors with an opportunity to bet against XRP’s price, mirroring the reverse of its daily performance. This development comes amid growing anticipation for regulatory approval of a spot XRP ETF. Traders on Polymarket are currently assessing a 77% probability that a spot XRP ETF will gain approval within this year. However, the likelihood of approval before July 31 is perceived to be lower, standing at 35%. Volatility Shares' filings position it alongside several other asset managers aiming to introduce XRP ETFs in the United States, including Grayscale, WisdomTree, Bitwise, 21Shares, CoinShares, and Canary Capital. In recent developments, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has initiated its review process for an XRP ETF filing by acknowledging a 19b-4 submission from the New York Stock Exchange and Grayscale. Meanwhile, the world's first spot XRP ETF is poised to launch in Brazil following approval from the country's securities regulator. This marks a significant step in the global expansion of XRP ETFs, reflecting the increasing interest and potential for these financial products in various markets.
