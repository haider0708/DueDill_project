According to Cointelegraph, Ethereum's much-anticipated Pectra upgrade is expected to play a pivotal role in shaping the next phase of the 2025 cryptocurrency market cycle. Despite Ether's recent underperformance compared to Bitcoin, analysts remain optimistic about its future prospects. The price of Ether (ETH) experienced a significant decline of over 32% in February, reaching a local low of $2,073 before rebounding to its current value of $2,245, as per Cointelegraph Markets Pro data. The Pectra upgrade, set for March 5, is anticipated to alleviate long-term selling pressure, according to Gabriel Halm, a research analyst at blockchain intelligence firm IntoTheBlock. Halm noted that while the upgrade may not immediately boost prices, it represents a crucial advancement in the ongoing enhancements to the Ethereum ecosystem. By reducing consensus overhead and enhancing Layer 2 scalability, the upgrade is expected to increase the network's overall capacity, thereby strengthening its competitive position. Furthermore, Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-7251 will raise the validator staking limit from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, facilitating easier compounding of earnings for validators and potentially reducing sell pressure over time. The substantial monthly correction in Ether's price may indicate a setup for the next upward movement, based on fractal patterns from the 2017 cycle, as shared by popular crypto trader Merlijn The Trader in a recent post. In the realm of crypto trading, technical traders utilize price fractal patterns to identify key support and resistance levels and potential trend reversals based on historical data. In parallel with these developments, the Ethereum Foundation has announced a leadership restructuring in response to criticism from community members who argue that the network is losing direction due to competition from high-throughput chains and layer-2 solutions. The Foundation introduced a new leadership structure with two co-directors: Hsiao-Wei Wang, a core researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, and Tomasz Stańczak, CEO of Nethermind, one of the largest execution clients on Ethereum. Wang and Stańczak will assume their roles on March 17, bringing extensive experience and leadership to the Foundation. This leadership change occurs amid growing concerns that layer-2 scaling solutions are cannibalizing Ethereum, and competition from emerging high-throughput chains is eroding investor confidence. To address these issues, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin outlined a strategy in a January blog post, which includes increasing the blob count to enhance transaction capacity and encouraging layer-2 solutions to contribute a portion of their fees to the base layer.

Ella Zhang, the head of YZi Labs, shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) that was originally created by CZ (Changpeng Zhao), the founder and former CEO of Binance. In her post, Zhang announced that long-term builders interested in creating projects based on CZ's token issuance idea can submit their applications to YZi Labs for priority review.CZ's idea, which has generated significant interest in the crypto community, proposes an unconventional approach to token issuance. The concept involves initially unlocking 10% of the tokens, which will then be sold on the market. The proceeds from the sale would be used to develop the product/platform, fund marketing efforts, and pay salaries. However, any future token unlocks will be subject to strict conditions:1. Six months after the previous unlock.2. ONLY IF the token price has sustained above 2x of the previous unlock price for more than 30 days immediately before the unlock.3. Up to 5% of tokens maximum each time.This strategy is designed to encourage sustained growth and ensure that token unlocks happen in a controlled and strategic manner.

Article Title: Bitcoin Active Addresses Surge, Indicating Potential Market Shift
According to Cointelegraph, Bitcoin's active addresses have reached a near three-month high, suggesting a possible market capitulation that could lead to a price reversal following the recent correction. Data from Glassnode reveals that active addresses on the Bitcoin network surged to over 912,300 on February 28, a level not observed since December 16, 2024, when Bitcoin was valued at approximately $105,000. The increase in active addresses may indicate a 'capitulation moment' for the cryptocurrency market, as noted by the crypto intelligence platform IntoTheBlock. The firm highlighted in a February 28 post that historically, spikes in on-chain activity have often aligned with market peaks and bottoms, driven by panic sellers exiting and opportunistic buyers entering the market. While no single metric can guarantee a price reversal, this surge suggests the market could be at a critical turning point. In financial markets, capitulation refers to investors selling their positions in panic, leading to a significant price decline and signaling an imminent market bottom before the start of the next uptrend. Bitcoin's ability to maintain a position above the $80,500 mark is crucial to avoid further losses. Stella Zlatareva, dispatch editor at digital asset investment platform Nexo, emphasized that Bitcoin's ability to reclaim $80,500 will be a key factor in determining near-term momentum. A breakout above this level could pave the way for further upside, while failing to establish it as support may lead to further testing on the downside. Bitcoin may revisit this crucial support if its price falls below $84,000. A potential correction below $84,000 could trigger over $1 billion worth of leveraged long liquidations across all exchanges, according to CoinGlass data. Despite short-term volatility, Bitcoin's price is closer to forming a market bottom than reaching a local top, as indicated by Bitcoin's market value to realized value (MVRV) Z-score. This technical indicator is used to determine whether an asset is overbought or oversold. On March 1, Bitcoin's MVRV Z-score stood at 2.01, signaling that Bitcoin's price is approaching the green territory at the bottom of the chart, becoming increasingly oversold, according to Glassnode data.

According to Cointelegraph, Ethereum's much-anticipated Pectra upgrade is expected to play a pivotal role in shaping the next phase of the 2025 cryptocurrency market cycle. Despite Ether's recent underperformance compared to Bitcoin, analysts remain optimistic about its future prospects. The price of Ether (ETH) experienced a significant decline of over 32% in February, reaching a local low of $2,073 before rebounding to its current value of $2,245, as per Cointelegraph Markets Pro data. The Pectra upgrade, set for March 5, is anticipated to alleviate long-term selling pressure, according to Gabriel Halm, a research analyst at blockchain intelligence firm IntoTheBlock. Halm noted that while the upgrade may not immediately boost prices, it represents a crucial advancement in the ongoing enhancements to the Ethereum ecosystem. By reducing consensus overhead and enhancing Layer 2 scalability, the upgrade is expected to increase the network's overall capacity, thereby strengthening its competitive position. Furthermore, Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-7251 will raise the validator staking limit from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, facilitating easier compounding of earnings for validators and potentially reducing sell pressure over time. The substantial monthly correction in Ether's price may indicate a setup for the next upward movement, based on fractal patterns from the 2017 cycle, as shared by popular crypto trader Merlijn The Trader in a recent post. In the realm of crypto trading, technical traders utilize price fractal patterns to identify key support and resistance levels and potential trend reversals based on historical data. In parallel with these developments, the Ethereum Foundation has announced a leadership restructuring in response to criticism from community members who argue that the network is losing direction due to competition from high-throughput chains and layer-2 solutions. The Foundation introduced a new leadership structure with two co-directors: Hsiao-Wei Wang, a core researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, and Tomasz Stańczak, CEO of Nethermind, one of the largest execution clients on Ethereum. Wang and Stańczak will assume their roles on March 17, bringing extensive experience and leadership to the Foundation. This leadership change occurs amid growing concerns that layer-2 scaling solutions are cannibalizing Ethereum, and competition from emerging high-throughput chains is eroding investor confidence. To address these issues, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin outlined a strategy in a January blog post, which includes increasing the blob count to enhance transaction capacity and encouraging layer-2 solutions to contribute a portion of their fees to the base layer.

Ella Zhang, the head of YZi Labs, shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) that was originally created by CZ (Changpeng Zhao), the founder and former CEO of Binance. In her post, Zhang announced that long-term builders interested in creating projects based on CZ's token issuance idea can submit their applications to YZi Labs for priority review.CZ's idea, which has generated significant interest in the crypto community, proposes an unconventional approach to token issuance. The concept involves initially unlocking 10% of the tokens, which will then be sold on the market. The proceeds from the sale would be used to develop the product/platform, fund marketing efforts, and pay salaries. However, any future token unlocks will be subject to strict conditions:1. Six months after the previous unlock.2. ONLY IF the token price has sustained above 2x of the previous unlock price for more than 30 days immediately before the unlock.3. Up to 5% of tokens maximum each time.This strategy is designed to encourage sustained growth and ensure that token unlocks happen in a controlled and strategic manner.

Additionally, Ju mentioned that Ethereum's leaders are considering stepping down, but there is no clear successor in place.

Article Title: Bitcoin Active Addresses Surge, Indicating Potential Market Shift
According to Cointelegraph, Bitcoin's active addresses have reached a near three-month high, suggesting a possible market capitulation that could lead to a price reversal following the recent correction. Data from Glassnode reveals that active addresses on the Bitcoin network surged to over 912,300 on February 28, a level not observed since December 16, 2024, when Bitcoin was valued at approximately $105,000. The increase in active addresses may indicate a 'capitulation moment' for the cryptocurrency market, as noted by the crypto intelligence platform IntoTheBlock. The firm highlighted in a February 28 post that historically, spikes in on-chain activity have often aligned with market peaks and bottoms, driven by panic sellers exiting and opportunistic buyers entering the market. While no single metric can guarantee a price reversal, this surge suggests the market could be at a critical turning point. In financial markets, capitulation refers to investors selling their positions in panic, leading to a significant price decline and signaling an imminent market bottom before the start of the next uptrend. Bitcoin's ability to maintain a position above the $80,500 mark is crucial to avoid further losses. Stella Zlatareva, dispatch editor at digital asset investment platform Nexo, emphasized that Bitcoin's ability to reclaim $80,500 will be a key factor in determining near-term momentum. A breakout above this level could pave the way for further upside, while failing to establish it as support may lead to further testing on the downside. Bitcoin may revisit this crucial support if its price falls below $84,000. A potential correction below $84,000 could trigger over $1 billion worth of leveraged long liquidations across all exchanges, according to CoinGlass data. Despite short-term volatility, Bitcoin's price is closer to forming a market bottom than reaching a local top, as indicated by Bitcoin's market value to realized value (MVRV) Z-score. This technical indicator is used to determine whether an asset is overbought or oversold. On March 1, Bitcoin's MVRV Z-score stood at 2.01, signaling that Bitcoin's price is approaching the green territory at the bottom of the chart, becoming increasingly oversold, according to Glassnode data.

According to Cointelegraph, Ethereum's much-anticipated Pectra upgrade is expected to play a pivotal role in shaping the next phase of the 2025 cryptocurrency market cycle. Despite Ether's recent underperformance compared to Bitcoin, analysts remain optimistic about its future prospects. The price of Ether (ETH) experienced a significant decline of over 32% in February, reaching a local low of $2,073 before rebounding to its current value of $2,245, as per Cointelegraph Markets Pro data. The Pectra upgrade, set for March 5, is anticipated to alleviate long-term selling pressure, according to Gabriel Halm, a research analyst at blockchain intelligence firm IntoTheBlock. Halm noted that while the upgrade may not immediately boost prices, it represents a crucial advancement in the ongoing enhancements to the Ethereum ecosystem. By reducing consensus overhead and enhancing Layer 2 scalability, the upgrade is expected to increase the network's overall capacity, thereby strengthening its competitive position. Furthermore, Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-7251 will raise the validator staking limit from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, facilitating easier compounding of earnings for validators and potentially reducing sell pressure over time. The substantial monthly correction in Ether's price may indicate a setup for the next upward movement, based on fractal patterns from the 2017 cycle, as shared by popular crypto trader Merlijn The Trader in a recent post. In the realm of crypto trading, technical traders utilize price fractal patterns to identify key support and resistance levels and potential trend reversals based on historical data. In parallel with these developments, the Ethereum Foundation has announced a leadership restructuring in response to criticism from community members who argue that the network is losing direction due to competition from high-throughput chains and layer-2 solutions. The Foundation introduced a new leadership structure with two co-directors: Hsiao-Wei Wang, a core researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, and Tomasz Stańczak, CEO of Nethermind, one of the largest execution clients on Ethereum. Wang and Stańczak will assume their roles on March 17, bringing extensive experience and leadership to the Foundation. This leadership change occurs amid growing concerns that layer-2 scaling solutions are cannibalizing Ethereum, and competition from emerging high-throughput chains is eroding investor confidence. To address these issues, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin outlined a strategy in a January blog post, which includes increasing the blob count to enhance transaction capacity and encouraging layer-2 solutions to contribute a portion of their fees to the base layer.

Ella Zhang, the head of YZi Labs, shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) that was originally created by CZ (Changpeng Zhao), the founder and former CEO of Binance. In her post, Zhang announced that long-term builders interested in creating projects based on CZ's token issuance idea can submit their applications to YZi Labs for priority review.CZ's idea, which has generated significant interest in the crypto community, proposes an unconventional approach to token issuance. The concept involves initially unlocking 10% of the tokens, which will then be sold on the market. The proceeds from the sale would be used to develop the product/platform, fund marketing efforts, and pay salaries. However, any future token unlocks will be subject to strict conditions:1. Six months after the previous unlock.2. ONLY IF the token price has sustained above 2x of the previous unlock price for more than 30 days immediately before the unlock.3. Up to 5% of tokens maximum each time.This strategy is designed to encourage sustained growth and ensure that token unlocks happen in a controlled and strategic manner.

Additionally, Ju mentioned that Ethereum's leaders are considering stepping down, but there is no clear successor in place.

Article Title: Bitcoin Active Addresses Surge, Indicating Potential Market Shift
According to Cointelegraph, Bitcoin's active addresses have reached a near three-month high, suggesting a possible market capitulation that could lead to a price reversal following the recent correction. Data from Glassnode reveals that active addresses on the Bitcoin network surged to over 912,300 on February 28, a level not observed since December 16, 2024, when Bitcoin was valued at approximately $105,000. The increase in active addresses may indicate a 'capitulation moment' for the cryptocurrency market, as noted by the crypto intelligence platform IntoTheBlock. The firm highlighted in a February 28 post that historically, spikes in on-chain activity have often aligned with market peaks and bottoms, driven by panic sellers exiting and opportunistic buyers entering the market. While no single metric can guarantee a price reversal, this surge suggests the market could be at a critical turning point. In financial markets, capitulation refers to investors selling their positions in panic, leading to a significant price decline and signaling an imminent market bottom before the start of the next uptrend. Bitcoin's ability to maintain a position above the $80,500 mark is crucial to avoid further losses. Stella Zlatareva, dispatch editor at digital asset investment platform Nexo, emphasized that Bitcoin's ability to reclaim $80,500 will be a key factor in determining near-term momentum. A breakout above this level could pave the way for further upside, while failing to establish it as support may lead to further testing on the downside. Bitcoin may revisit this crucial support if its price falls below $84,000. A potential correction below $84,000 could trigger over $1 billion worth of leveraged long liquidations across all exchanges, according to CoinGlass data. Despite short-term volatility, Bitcoin's price is closer to forming a market bottom than reaching a local top, as indicated by Bitcoin's market value to realized value (MVRV) Z-score. This technical indicator is used to determine whether an asset is overbought or oversold. On March 1, Bitcoin's MVRV Z-score stood at 2.01, signaling that Bitcoin's price is approaching the green territory at the bottom of the chart, becoming increasingly oversold, according to Glassnode data.

According to Cointelegraph, Ethereum's much-anticipated Pectra upgrade is expected to play a pivotal role in shaping the next phase of the 2025 cryptocurrency market cycle. Despite Ether's recent underperformance compared to Bitcoin, analysts remain optimistic about its future prospects. The price of Ether (ETH) experienced a significant decline of over 32% in February, reaching a local low of $2,073 before rebounding to its current value of $2,245, as per Cointelegraph Markets Pro data. The Pectra upgrade, set for March 5, is anticipated to alleviate long-term selling pressure, according to Gabriel Halm, a research analyst at blockchain intelligence firm IntoTheBlock. Halm noted that while the upgrade may not immediately boost prices, it represents a crucial advancement in the ongoing enhancements to the Ethereum ecosystem. By reducing consensus overhead and enhancing Layer 2 scalability, the upgrade is expected to increase the network's overall capacity, thereby strengthening its competitive position. Furthermore, Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-7251 will raise the validator staking limit from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, facilitating easier compounding of earnings for validators and potentially reducing sell pressure over time. The substantial monthly correction in Ether's price may indicate a setup for the next upward movement, based on fractal patterns from the 2017 cycle, as shared by popular crypto trader Merlijn The Trader in a recent post. In the realm of crypto trading, technical traders utilize price fractal patterns to identify key support and resistance levels and potential trend reversals based on historical data. In parallel with these developments, the Ethereum Foundation has announced a leadership restructuring in response to criticism from community members who argue that the network is losing direction due to competition from high-throughput chains and layer-2 solutions. The Foundation introduced a new leadership structure with two co-directors: Hsiao-Wei Wang, a core researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, and Tomasz Stańczak, CEO of Nethermind, one of the largest execution clients on Ethereum. Wang and Stańczak will assume their roles on March 17, bringing extensive experience and leadership to the Foundation. This leadership change occurs amid growing concerns that layer-2 scaling solutions are cannibalizing Ethereum, and competition from emerging high-throughput chains is eroding investor confidence. To address these issues, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin outlined a strategy in a January blog post, which includes increasing the blob count to enhance transaction capacity and encouraging layer-2 solutions to contribute a portion of their fees to the base layer.

Ella Zhang, the head of YZi Labs, shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) that was originally created by CZ (Changpeng Zhao), the founder and former CEO of Binance. In her post, Zhang announced that long-term builders interested in creating projects based on CZ's token issuance idea can submit their applications to YZi Labs for priority review.CZ's idea, which has generated significant interest in the crypto community, proposes an unconventional approach to token issuance. The concept involves initially unlocking 10% of the tokens, which will then be sold on the market. The proceeds from the sale would be used to develop the product/platform, fund marketing efforts, and pay salaries. However, any future token unlocks will be subject to strict conditions:1. Six months after the previous unlock.2. ONLY IF the token price has sustained above 2x of the previous unlock price for more than 30 days immediately before the unlock.3. Up to 5% of tokens maximum each time.This strategy is designed to encourage sustained growth and ensure that token unlocks happen in a controlled and strategic manner.

Article Title: Bitcoin Active Addresses Surge, Indicating Potential Market Shift
According to Cointelegraph, Bitcoin's active addresses have reached a near three-month high, suggesting a possible market capitulation that could lead to a price reversal following the recent correction. Data from Glassnode reveals that active addresses on the Bitcoin network surged to over 912,300 on February 28, a level not observed since December 16, 2024, when Bitcoin was valued at approximately $105,000. The increase in active addresses may indicate a 'capitulation moment' for the cryptocurrency market, as noted by the crypto intelligence platform IntoTheBlock. The firm highlighted in a February 28 post that historically, spikes in on-chain activity have often aligned with market peaks and bottoms, driven by panic sellers exiting and opportunistic buyers entering the market. While no single metric can guarantee a price reversal, this surge suggests the market could be at a critical turning point. In financial markets, capitulation refers to investors selling their positions in panic, leading to a significant price decline and signaling an imminent market bottom before the start of the next uptrend. Bitcoin's ability to maintain a position above the $80,500 mark is crucial to avoid further losses. Stella Zlatareva, dispatch editor at digital asset investment platform Nexo, emphasized that Bitcoin's ability to reclaim $80,500 will be a key factor in determining near-term momentum. A breakout above this level could pave the way for further upside, while failing to establish it as support may lead to further testing on the downside. Bitcoin may revisit this crucial support if its price falls below $84,000. A potential correction below $84,000 could trigger over $1 billion worth of leveraged long liquidations across all exchanges, according to CoinGlass data. Despite short-term volatility, Bitcoin's price is closer to forming a market bottom than reaching a local top, as indicated by Bitcoin's market value to realized value (MVRV) Z-score. This technical indicator is used to determine whether an asset is overbought or oversold. On March 1, Bitcoin's MVRV Z-score stood at 2.01, signaling that Bitcoin's price is approaching the green territory at the bottom of the chart, becoming increasingly oversold, according to Glassnode data.

Article Title: Ethereum Researcher Proposes Solution to Address Centralization and Eliminate MEV
According to Cointelegraph, a new proposal has been introduced by an Ethereum researcher, aiming to decentralize the current block building process on the Ethereum network. The proposal, named 'Decentralized Random Block Proposal,' seeks to implement a shared random algorithm to democratize block proposing and eliminate Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) at the block level. This approach leverages Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) to potentially accelerate the propagation of transactions to network validators, as explained by the pseudonymous researcher Malik672 in a recent post.Malik672 highlighted that while Ethereum's proof-of-stake model and the proposer-builder separation feature have somewhat reduced the concentration of MEV, they have also led to increased centralization among builders and relays. Ethereum Foundation researcher Toni Wahrstätter noted that two block builders, Beaverbuild and Titan Builder, were responsible for constructing 88.7% of all Ethereum blocks in the first half of October. Although this figure has decreased to around 80%, it remains higher than desired by the Ethereum community.The proposed system aims to distribute block building across thousands of clients globally, thereby fully democratizing the process and preventing any single entity from dominating. Unlike the current Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS) method, which relies on a centralized builder pool, the new system uses BFT to mitigate mempool variance and ensure robustness. MEV, which involves profit-driven manipulation strategies like arbitrage and front-running, has been a concern for ordinary network users, as it undermines Ethereum's decentralized ethos.Under Malik672's proposal, all Ethereum clients would construct blocks using a cryptographically random algorithm, preventing the manipulation tactics that currently impact users. This solution aligns with Ethereum's trustless roots and remains compatible with Danksharding's blob requirements, a solution aimed at scaling Ethereum layer 2s. Additionally, the proposal could potentially reduce slot times from 12 seconds to approximately 6 to 8 seconds.This development comes as Ethereum developers and researchers have agreed to deploy upgrades at a faster pace, as announced on February 13, to accelerate Ethereum's technical roadmap. The ongoing efforts to enhance Ethereum's infrastructure reflect the community's commitment to maintaining its decentralized nature while improving efficiency and scalability.

Article Title: BNB Chain Leads the Way in AI-Powered Web3: An In-Depth Look
In a recent interview with Binance News,  BNB Chain emphasized its commitment to becoming an AI-first blockchain. While navigating competition from other players like Solana, BNB Chain is focused on strengthening its ecosystem and infrastructure, with plans to reduce transaction latency and enable gasless transactions. Notably, BNB Chain projects have already begun making waves, particularly in the meme coin space, with popular tokens such as 1000CHEEMS and TST gaining significant attention.BNB Chain's Evolution as an AI-First Blockchain“BNB Chain is positioning itself as an AI-first blockchain,” said the BNB Chain team. 2025 is set to be the year BNB Chain fully embraces AI technology, positioning itself as the go-to blockchain for AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps). The ecosystem already supports over 60 AI projects, ranging from AI agents like Myshell and Eliza, to AI-powered gaming and decentralized social networks. A key element of BNB Chain's AI vision is the integration of AI agents capable of autonomous decision-making. Unlike traditional models, these agents will learn from real-time data, adapt to dynamic environments, and make independent decisions based on personalized user interactions. To support this, BNB Chain is creating secure environments for AI operations through Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and decentralized storage solutions. The team is also developing a toolkit to streamline AI integration into Web3.Strengthening Support for Meme Coin ProjectsBNB Chain is also enhancing its support for meme coin projects, which have gained significant popularity in recent years. The platform is implementing various incentive programs, such as liquidity pool (LP) support and validator priority mechanisms, to ensure that meme coins continue to thrive within the ecosystem. These efforts are designed to enhance the user experience during the meme season, providing additional resources and opportunities for these community-driven tokens.Accelerating Mass Adoption of Blockchain TechnologyBNB Chain is equally focused on driving real-world adoption of blockchain technology. One example of this is the Gas-Free Carnival, an initiative launched in September 2024 that eliminates gas fees for stablecoin transfers and withdrawals. Supported by platforms like Binance and major centralized exchanges, the event aims to make it easier for users to interact with the Web3 world. This initiative is part of BNB Chain's broader strategy to promote stablecoin adoption. “We use stablecoins to empower and donate to PhD students and users who have suffered from scams. Stablecoins provide a stable and lower-risk entry point for new users, making them an essential component of BNB Chain's strategy to drive mass adoption of Web3,” the team said.Among the most notable updates in 2025 is the introduction of gasless transactions. By expanding its paymaster services, BNB Chain will enable dApps to cover gas fees for their users, further simplifying the onboarding process for new participants in the Web3 space.BNB Chain’s strategy for expanding Web3 adoption extends to scalability, cross-chain interoperability, and enhanced security. Through initiatives like the BNB Incubation Alliance (BIA) and the Most Valuable Builder (MVB) program, BNB Chain is fostering innovation and encouraging developers to build within its ecosystem, which spans sectors such as DeFi, AI, gaming, and decentralized science (DeSci).What Role Does CZ Play in BNB Chain’s Strategy?Although Changpeng Zhao (CZ), founder and former CEO of Binance, does not hold an official position within BNB Chain, he remains an active community member and a major holder of BNB. His discussions and insights often attract attention, sparking conversations among stakeholders. BNB Chain said it values the constructive feedback it receives from all community members, including CZ, recognizing that his contributions have broader implications for the Web3 ecosystem.BNB Chain’s Vision: Redefining Speed and Scalability in 2025Looking toward 2025, BNB Chain's primary goal is to enhance both speed and scalability for its users. By reducing block time from three seconds to sub-second speeds, BNB Chain aims to drastically improve transaction efficiency, making it one of the fastest blockchains in the industry. With these upgrades, BNB Chain will be able to process up to 100 million transactions per day, ensuring users experience minimal delays and maximum throughput.“For users, this means an easier entrance to Web3 and faster transaction times, decreasing block time while maintaining high network throughput. BNB Chain will continue to enhance the user experience.” the team said.Read More BNB Chain Announces Pascal Hardfork: Key Upgrades for Ethereum Compatibility and Smart Contract Wallets BNB Chain Launches $4.4M Liquidity Pool Support Program for Top MemecoinsBNB Chain Introduces Plugin for AI Integration with Eliza FrameworkDisclaimerThis article includes third-party opinions and does not constitute financial advice.

Article Title: Ethereum Foundation Announces New Leadership Amid Community Debate
According to CoinDesk, the Ethereum Foundation (EF), a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the development and research of the Ethereum blockchain, has appointed Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz Stańczak as its new co-executive directors. This announcement was made in a blog post on Saturday, following the recent news of Aya Miyaguchi stepping down from her role as executive director to become the EF's new president. The leadership changes come amid ongoing discussions within the community regarding the EF's influence in the ecosystem. Some community members have criticized the organization and its leadership for the underperformance of Ethereum's token, ether (ETH), compared to other cryptocurrencies. Additionally, Ethereum has seen a decline in attracting new developers, with its competitor Solana surpassing it for the first time. Wang has been with the Ethereum Foundation since 2017, contributing to research on key concepts such as sharding and playing a significant role in Ethereum's major transition known as "the Merge." Stańczak, on the other hand, is the founder of Nethermind, one of the largest software clients operating on the Ethereum blockchain. The Foundation emphasized in their blog post that the Ethereum ecosystem faces the challenge of transitioning from an early-stage project catering to a small group of enthusiasts to becoming a robust, permissionless, and censorship-resistant base layer for global finance and software. Further changes within the Ethereum community include former EF researcher Danny Ryan joining Etherealize, a new initiative aimed at integrating Ethereum with Wall Street. Etherealize was founded by ex-banker Vivek Raman, who previously stated that the project's goal is to bridge the gap between Ethereum and financial institutions by educating them and promoting ETH as a credible crypto asset. In a post shared on X, Ryan expressed his intention to "build a new Ethereum institution with Real World Ethereum as its north star," highlighting the readiness of the world to embrace blockchain technology and the commitment to undertake the necessary efforts to facilitate this transition.

Article Title: Swiss National Bank Rejects Bitcoin Reserves Proposal
According to CoinDesk, Swiss National Bank (SNB) President Martin Schlegel has dismissed the idea of incorporating bitcoin into Switzerland's central bank reserves. Schlegel highlighted concerns over the cryptocurrency's volatility, liquidity, and security as primary reasons for this decision. In an interview with the Tamedia group, he emphasized that the instability of cryptocurrencies makes them unsuitable for preserving long-term value. Schlegel further explained that the central bank's reserves must remain highly liquid to be readily available for monetary policy interventions. He also pointed out the inherent security risks associated with software-based assets, noting that software can be prone to bugs and vulnerabilities. These remarks come amid a broader discussion in Switzerland regarding the potential inclusion of bitcoin in the SNB's reserves. A recent initiative, spearheaded by entrepreneur Yves Bennaim, is advocating for a constitutional amendment that would require the SNB to hold bitcoin alongside gold in its reserves. This initiative, launched in December, aims to gather 100,000 signatures within 18 months to prompt a nationwide vote on the matter. While the proposal does not specify the exact bitcoin allocations, it suggests that the reserves should be built from the bank's earnings. Despite the increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in Switzerland, with several Swiss banks offering cryptocurrency-related services, Schlegel remains skeptical. He described cryptocurrencies as a "niche phenomenon" and expressed confidence in the Swiss franc's continued strength. Schlegel stated that the SNB is "not afraid of competition from cryptocurrencies," underscoring the enduring stability of traditional currencies.
