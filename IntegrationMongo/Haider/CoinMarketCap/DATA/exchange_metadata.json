            "description": "## What Is Bitstamp?\n\nFounded in 2011, Bitstamp is one of the longest-standing and most regulated [centralized crypto exchanges](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/centralized-exchange-cex)(CEXs), serving more than 4 million customers worldwide in over 100 countries. \n\nWhether users want to trade on their web platform, mobile app, or APIs, Bitstamp provides a convenient and easy-to-use access to crypto. They take special pride in the fact the exchange has been built on security, transparency and regulation, which is reflected by their AA rating as the world’s top-rated crypto exchange in CryptoCompare’s Exchange Benchmark report. \n\nBitstamp customers have access to up to 80 [digital assets](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/digital-asset) and do not charge trading fees on the first $1000 in trading volume over a 30-day rolling period. Customers can use debit or credit cards, ACH transfers, Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal and international bank transfers to purchase cryptocurrencies. Crypto beginners can get started with the help of a wide range of educational resources on Bitstamp’s Learn Center, intuitive features on trading platforms, and a 24/7/365 live support service. For more advanced traders, the exchange offers competitive trading fees, Tradeview, an enhanced version of the platform with advanced trading tools, and a crypto reward program with staking - Bitstamp Earn.  \n\nBitstamp holds 50 licenses and registrations globally. It was the first crypto exchange to receive a Payment Institution License in the EU, holds a BitLicense in New York, and undergoes regular audits by a global Big Four accounting firm. 95% of crypto held at Bitstamp is securely stored offline and their custodians hold additional insurance for client assets in cold wallets. Bitstamp also holds all customer assets in 1:1 custody and separate from Bitstamp entity assets. All this forms the basis of the principle they operate in accordance with – the customers’ crypto is always theirs.\n\n## Who Are the Bitstamp Founders?\n\nBitstamp was founded in Kranj, Slovenia, by Damian Merlak and Nejc Kodrič in August 2011. In 2018, NXMH, a Brussels-based holding company with more than €2 billion of assets under management, acquired 80% of the Bitstamp shares. NXMH focuses on long-term private equity investments in leading European companies with strong potential for international expansion. \n\nDamian Merlak graduated from the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia, with a degree in Computer and Information Science. After starting his career as a software developer, he served as Bitstamp’s CTO until 2015 and director until 2018. Nejc Kodric obtained degrees in Economics and Information Science from the University in Kranj, Slovenia.  Prior to launching Bitstamp, he co-founded a computer hardware and IT consulting firm. \n\nToday, Bitstamp is led by a highly experienced team of 7 compliance-driven professionals with extensive backgrounds in both traditional and decentralized finance. \n\n\n##When did Bitstamp Launch?  \n\nBitstamp was founded and launched in 2011. \n\n\n## Where Is Bitstamp Located?\n\nBitstamp has offices in Luxembourg, Singapore, Slovenia, the UK and the USA. \n\n\n## Bitstamp Restricted Countries\n\nBitstamp’s services are available in over 100 countries, although some features might be restricted in certain areas.  \n\n\n## What Coins Are Supported on Bitstamp?\n\nBitstamp lists up to 80 carefully handpicked cryptocurrencies, including [BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/), [ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), [LTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/litecoin/), [XRP](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/), [USDT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/) and [USDC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/) and more.\n\n\n## How Much Are Bitstamp Fees?\n\nFor all trading pairs, fees are charged on a [maker-taker model](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/market-maker-market-taker) and based on 30-day [trading volume](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/trading-volume). In their strive to make crypto accessible to all, Bitstamp has no trading fees for the first $1,000 in trading volume over a 30-day rolling period. For trading volumes under $10,000, the maker-taker fees start at 0.3% to 0.4% and decrease as trading volume increases. The trading fees on fiat/stablecoin trades are 80% lower than on all other crypto pairs. \n\nFor staking, the exchange charges a flat 15% commission on the rewards.

            "description": "## What Is Zaif?\n\nZaif is a Japanese centralized cryptocurrency exchange (CEX). It was one of the first crypto exchanges to obtain a license from the Japanese Financial Services Agency (JFSA). As of September 2018, it was ranked as the 35th largest cryptocurrency exchange by turnover. However, on September 14, 2018, the exchange’s hot wallets were hacked, with the equivalent of $60 million in cryptocurrency stolen.\n\nFollowing the incident, Zaif suspended operations, entering a bailout agreement with FISCO, a Japanese brokerage that injected 5 billion yen ($44.675 million) in financial support. In November, the company was sold to FISCO Digital Asset Group Co. Ltd.\n\n\n## Who Are the Founders of Zaif?\n\nThe company was founded by Takao Asayama, CEO of Tech Bureau. Tech Bureau operated Zaif until FISCO purchased it in late 2018. At the time of publication, Ryuji Yagi headed the platform. Other members of the management team include Toshiya Kotake, Norifumi Imai, Takayoshi Abe, Kenji Yamaguchi, and Osamu Fukami.\n\nCoinMarketCap could not confirm the background of these individuals since the majority of them do not have LinkedIn profiles.\n\n\n## When Did Zaif Launch?\n\nZaif made its debut on June 16, 2014.\n\n\n## Where Is Zaif Located?\n\nThe cryptocurrency exchange operates out of Japan’s busy capital city of Tokyo.\n\n\n## Zaif Restricted Countries\n\nCoinMarketCap has been unable to confirm if any countries are restricted from using Zaif. However, besides the fact that the exchange is mostly in Japanese, an August 2022 announcement from the company said that the platform was “currently not accepting applications for opening an account for customers residing overseas. In addition, even if you are a customer who has completed identity verification in the past, we may refuse to use it at our discretion.”\n\n\n## What Coins Are Supported on Zaif?\n\nThe trading platform offers a limited number of digital assets. With just ten coins and 14 markets, BTC/JPY is the most active trading pair on the exchange.\n\n\n## How Much Are Zaif Fees?\n\nZaif charges some of the lowest fees in the cryptocurrency exchange market — 0.10% for takers and free of charge for makers for its spot trading market.\n\n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trading on Zaif?\n\nUsers can trade on margin with a leverage of up to 7.7x on the exchange platform.",

            "description": "## What Is Gate.io?\n\nGate.io is a [centralized cryptocurrency exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/centralized-exchange-cex) where users can find a large number of crypto [coins](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/coin) and tokens to trade. The platform supports over 1400 cryptocurrencies with over 2500 trading pairs. The project occupies one of the leading positions in terms of trading volume (more than 12 billion dollars in trading volume daily) and supports [spot](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/spot-trading) and [margin trading](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/margin-trading). It also expanded services to other markets, including [options](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/options-market), [futures](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/futures), and [derivatives](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/derivative) for investors.\n\nLaunched in 2013, the platform claims to be “steady and reliable,” offering a user-friendly platform with 24/7 customer support and a robust mobile app. However, the exchange is not highly regulated, and does not offer the option to withdraw [fiat](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/fiat). In order to withdraw funds from accounts or deposit cryptocurrencies, users go through a mandatory [KYC](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/kyc) or “Know Your Customer” process.\n\n\n## Who Are the Gate.io Founders?\n\nIn 2013, the exchange was established in China by founder and current CEO Lin Han. He wanted to create a secure trading platform for everyone who believes in Bitcoin. Lin Han holds a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Software Engineering and a Master’s degree in Mathematics and Computer Science.\n\n\n## When Did Gate.io Launch?\n\nIt was launched in 2013 under the name Bter or Bter.com, then in the fall of 2017 the exchange was taken over by Gate Technology Inc. and has been renamed.\n\n\n## Where Is Gate.io Located?\n\nGate.io is the earliest crypto-to-crypto exchange from China. The company is located in the Cayman Islands.\n\n\n## Gate.io Restricted Countries\n\nThe platform is available to all countries except Cuba, Sudan, Syria, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, Pakistan, and Crimea. Some services are not available to residents of the US (in Washington, New York) and Canada.\n\n\n## What Coins Are Supported on Gate.io?\n\nAlmost all the leading coins of the industry are listed on the platform, among them the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap.\n\n\n## How Much Are Gate.io Fees?\n\nCommissions on the platform are quite competitive — while trading on the exchange, users do not have to pay deposit fees, while fees for withdrawal vary depending on the cryptocurrency.\n\nSpot and futures trading fees are based on a tiered VIP level — depending on the user’s 30-day trading volume — and range from VIP 0 to VIP 16. Rates are based on a maker-taker model.\n\n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trading on Gate.io?\n\nGate.io offers to its clients margin trading with 10X leverage. The volume of the margin loan is determined by the leverage ratio: the exchange provides leverage ratios from 3X to 10X, which varies from market to market.\n",

The platform supports futures trading, a built-in P2P exchange, the ability to purchase cryptocurrencies with a credit or debit card, and instant exchange services.\n\nA Community for Everyone\n\nAs an exchange for, by, and of the people, KuCoin is developing a community where everyone can benefit from growth and have their opinions heard.\n\nAlso known as “people's exchange”, the platform facilitated 1.2 trillion in lifetime trading volume and supports over 37 million users worldwide. The company claims to offer technology-driven trading products and the KuCoin ecosystem, which encompasses the KuCoin community and is built around the KuCoin token (KCS).\n\n## Who Are the KuCoin Founders?\n\nKuCoin was founded in 2017 by Michael, Eric, Top, Kent, John, Jack and Linda. The exchange officially launched in September 2017.\n\nIn 2020, when KuCoin is a top-5 exchange in the world, Johnny Lyu stepped in as the CEO. Before joining KuCoin, he worked in the tech, internet and e-commerce industries.\n\n## When did KuCoin Launch?\n\nKuCoin was launched in 2017\n\n## Where Is KuCoin Located?\n\nThe company is international, headquartered in the Seychelles and offices in Hong Kong and Singapore, with more than 37 million users worldwide and a presence in over 200 countries.\n\nKuCoin Restricted Countries\n\nThe platform provides services to over 200 countries such as Turkey, India and many others. Please check their official website for supported countries.\n\n## What Coins Are Supported on KuCoin?\n\nThe platform has a large number of trading pairs, it offers nearly 700 cryptocurrencies for buying, selling and trading, the list of the top coins includes BTC, ETH, USDT, BNB, ADA, XRP, USDC, DOGE, DOT, UNI and more.\n\n## How Much Are KuCoin Fees?\n\nKuCoin's base fee is 0.1% for both market makers and takers.The higher your trading fee level is, the lower your trading fee is, even a negative fee rate is possible.\n\nBeing a Maker/Taker would also affect your trading fee rate.In a Market/Hidden/Iceberg Order, you will be charged a taker fee as a taker.In a Limit Order( With Post Only function enabled), you will be charged a maker fee as a maker.\n\nThe trading fee rate can also be affected if you enable the KCS pay fees function.\n\nKuCoin deducts the token after the slash of a trade pair as the fee token. For example, users will pay USDT/KCS as the trading fee token for BTC/USDT, LTC/KCS. It's worth noting that in certain trading, the same coin will be charged as the fee, and the actual trade quantity may be different from the quantity that arrives in the account because a certain part is deducted as the fee.\n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trading on KuCoin?\n\nKuCoin provides multiple products which support leverage to magnify the market volatilities. Starting from the basics will be margin trade for spot, which supports up to 10X leverage with multiple assets. Next level will be derivatives, futures trading, which supports up to 125X leverage with selected assets for clearing.

A rebranding effort was set in motion on March 22, 2021, as part of an initiative to become the leading financial platform for cryptocurrencies, combining the strengths of a centralized trading platform with DeFi.\n\nDriven by its continuous product development and early-mover advantage in strategic alignment with the DeFi ecosystem, AscendEX offers trading services across over 200 trading pairs across cash, margin, and futures products, in particular margin trading of over 50 tokens in cross-asset collateral mode and futures trading in both cross-asset and isolated margin modes.\n\nOn December 11, 2021, malicious actors managed to access the exchange’s hot wallets, reportedly stealing $77.7 million across three chains – Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon.\n\n## Who Are the Founders of Ascendex?\n\nAscendEX was founded by Dr. Jing Cao. He has garnered experience working as the Chief Investment Officer at Delpha Capital Management LLC, Chief Executive Officer for HD Consulting Services Group, Inc., and Portfolio Manager at Knight Capital Group, Inc. Jing Cao received an undergraduate degree from the University of Science & Technology of China and a doctorate from The University of Chicago.\n\n\n## When Did AscendEX Launch?\n\nThe company launched under the \"BitMax\" name in August 2018.\n\n\n## Where Is AscendEX Located?\n\nThe company is headquartered in Singapore.\n\n\n## AscendEX Restricted Countries\n\nAccording to the company’s terms of service, its services are not offered to residents of Singapore, China (Mainland), the US, and “five US permanently inhabited territories - Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands in the North Pacific Ocean, and American Samoa in the South Pacific Ocean.” Furthermore, the services are restricted for citizens and residents of regions where crypto trading is banned.\n\n\n## What Coins Are Supported on Ascendex?\n\nOver 250 digital assets are listed on the exchange. Customers can trade on more than 320 pairs.\n\n\n## How Much Are Ascendex Fees?\n\nThere are 9 VIP levels determined by the 30-day trade volume and 30-day average ASD holdings of a user. The transaction fees are based on the user’s VIP level. For large market cap assets, the fees are 0-0.1% for makers and 0.02-0.1% for takers. The maker fees are 0-0.2%, while the taker fees make up 0.02-0.2% for other altcoins.\n\n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trading on Ascendex?\n\nAscendEX allows margin trading, with leverage of up to 3X, 5X, 10X and 25X.",

            "description": "## What Is Binance.US?\n\nBinance.US is the U.S. registered arm of the world’s largest [cryptocurrency exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/centralized-exchange-cex) by [trading volume](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/trading-volume) — Binance. The separate exchange was launched in response to U.S. regulations restricting the main exchange. While Binance owns the Binance.US name and intellectual property, the exchange is managed independently by BAM Trading Services. Both exchanges differ in terms of deposit and withdrawal methods, [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity) and trading fees.\n\nMoreover, the U.S. platform offers users fewer cryptocurrencies and trading pairs than the global site, with 120+ assets, while the main exchange lists about 600. The platform is not available in all 50 states of America.\n\n\n## Who Are the Binance.US Founders?\n\nThe exchange was launched in September 2019 and is managed independently by BAM Trading Services. The company's CEO is Brian Shroder, a former executive director of Ant Group Co. and Uber Technologies Inc. Shroder graduated from Harvard Business School with an MBA and holds dual BS degrees in Accountancy and Management from\n\nMiami University.\n\n\n## Where Is Binance.US Located?\n\nBinance.US is based in Palo Alto, California.\n\n\n## Binance.US Restricted Countries\n\nThe U.S.-based exchange is not available in Hawaii, Texas, New York and Vermont.\n\n\n## What Coins Are Supported on Binance.US?\n\nThe platform provides access to more than 120 cryptocurrencies and offers over 60 trading pairs with digital assets like [BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/), [ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), [ADA](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cardano/), [BCH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/), [BNB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bnb/), [LINK](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chainlink/), [LTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/litecoin/) and more.\n\n\n## How Much Are Binance.US Fees?\n\nBinance.US offers free Bitcoin trading, claiming to be the only major exchange to do so in the U.S. Trading pairs are categorized in three tiers — “Tier 0,” “Tier I” and “Tier II” — fees on “Tier 0” pairs are 0%.\n\nFees on “Tier I” and “Tier II” pairs depend on the user’s VIP level — ascertained by one’s 30-day trading volume. For “Tier I,” maker fee ranges from 0.0750% (VIP 1) to free (VIP 9), while taker fee ranges from 0.1500% (VIP 1) to 0.0375% (VIP 9). For “Tier II,” maker fee ranges from 0.3000% (VIP 1) to free (VIP 9), and taker fee ranges from 0.4500% (VIP 1) to 0.0375% (VIP 9).\n\nFurthermore, users can receive 25% off fees if they use [BNB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bnb/) to pay. \n\n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trading on Binance.US?\n\nOn the platform, users cannot trade futures or invest with a margin account.",

Together, Liu and Mei continue to uphold BTSE's commitment to providing a secure and user-friendly platform for trading cryptocurrencies and bridging traditional finance with digital asset solutions.\n\n##When did BTSE Launch?\n\nBTSE was launched in 2018 by a team specializing in high-frequency, low-latency, trading technology. The platform has since grown to be a crowd favorite about derivatives traders due to the advanced features offered.\n\n##Where is BTSE Located?\n\nBTSE is international - registered in the British Virgin Islands with offices in Taipei, Singapore, Hong Kong and Dubai. \n\n##BTSE Restricted Countries\n\nUnder BTSE’s Terms and Conditions, restricted geographies include the United States, Iran and Syria. While users may be able to register for accounts, certain features will be unavailable without identity verification.\n\n##How Much Are BTSE Fees?\n\nOne of the stand-out features of BTSE is its highly competitive trading fees. For general users, trading fees for futures are 0.01% for maker orders and 0.05% for taker orders, while spot trading fees start at 0.20% for both maker and taker orders.\n\nHowever, for traders looking to take advantage of even lower fees, BTSE has implemented a 10-tier VIP program. This program rewards users with fee reductions based on their trading volume and BTSE token holdings. For example, the VIP program can reduce futures fees down to as low as -0.02% for maker orders and 0.036% for taker orders, while spot trading fees can be reduced to 0.02% for maker orders and 0.06% for taker orders.\n\nIn addition to the VIP program, all users can enjoy 0% maker fees on all markets by simply staking 100 BTSE tokens. The staking program has 8 tiers, and by staking the maximum of 20,000 BTSE tokens, maker fees become a rebate at -0.003%, which applies to both futures and spot trading. There are no volume requirements attached to the BTSE staking program.\n\nTo reward new sign-ups, BTSE also offers a 25% discount on trading fees for the first 30 days for users who have been referred.\n\n##Is It Possible to Use Leverage or Margin Trading on BTSE?\n\nBTSE offers leveraged futures trading on its platform, allowing traders to amplify their profits. Users can trade with up to 100x leverage on perpetual futures and up to 20x leverage on dated futures contracts.\n\nBTSE's multi-asset collateral and multi-asset settlement options allow for greater flexibility in futures trading. Traders can choose between cross and isolated futures wallets for better risk control. Additionally, sub-accounts are available to all users who require solid risk management and a range of order types including stop-loss, trailing stops, and take profit.\n\nThe platform also includes automated and customisable margin call notifications and advanced order types such as TWAP, OCO and algorithmic index orders – which also allows for hidden orders. Real-time streaming quotes provide traders with up-to-date market data to inform their decisions.",

            "description": "## What Is Curve Finance?\n\nCurve Finance is a [decentralized](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized) [liquidity pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool) for [stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/stablecoin) trading. Instead of an [order book](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/order-book), it uses an [AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) (automated market maker) model to match [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity). As a decentralized and permissionless protocol, anyone can [provide](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens) liquidity to one or more of the [liquidity pools](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool). The constant product formula of the AMM ensures maximum efficiency while incurring a minimum of [slippage](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/slippage) for traders. \n\nThe Curve pools are [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) implementing the StableSwap invariant and enabling the exchange of two or more tokens. Token [swaps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) can be performed between paired stablecoins (Plain Pools) or between [wrapped](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-wrapped-ethereum-weth) tokens, with the underlying collateral lent out on another protocol (Lending Pools). Finally, Metapools pair stablecoins against LP-tokens from another pool.\n\nThe protocol is available multi-chain — on [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), [Arbitrum](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-arbitrum-the-ultimate-guide-to-the-arbitrum-ecosystem), [Aurora](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aurora-near/), [Avalanche](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/), [Fantom](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/fantom/), [Harmony](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/harmony/), [Optimism](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-optimism-the-ultimate-guide-to-the-optimism-ecosystem), [Polygon](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polygon/), [xDai](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xdai/) and [Moonbeam](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/moonbeam/). Users typically have to [bridge](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/bridges) funds from Ethereum to these chains to use the Curve protocol. Due to its systemic importance for [decentralized finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi) (DeFi), the protocol has attracted several other protocols fighting over its [governance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance) in the so-called [Curve Wars](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/curve-wars-and-the-emergency-dao). \n\n\n## Who Is the Curve Finance Founder?\n\nCurve Finance was founded by Michael Egorov, the former co-founder and CTO of NuCypher, a cryptocurrency infrastructure protocol. He also founded LoanCoin, a decentralized bank and loans network. Before his work in the cryptocurrency industry, Egorov studied at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and the Swinburne University of Technology. \n\n\n## When Did Curve Finance Launch?\n\nCurve Finance was launched in June 2020, amidst the so-called DeFi Summer, and is considered one of the core building blocks of the nascent [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi) sector.\n\n\n## Where Is Curve Finance Located?\n\nAccording to CBInsights, Curve Finance has its headquarters in Switzerland.  \n\n \n\n\n## Curve Finance Restricted Countries\n\nAt the time of writing, there is no information about possible restricted countries. However, users from countries under US financial sanctions may be subject to geoblocking. \n\n\n## Curve Finance Supported Coins List \n\nThe exchange supports liquidity pools for major stablecoins like [DAI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/), [USDC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/), [USDT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/), [FRAX](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/frax/) and [TUSD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/trueusd/). It also offers swaps between wrapped tokens like [wBTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wrapped-bitcoin/), [wETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/weth/) and [stETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/steth/) (a derivative of staked Ether native to [Lido](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/lido-dao/)). \n\n\n## How Much Are Curve Finance Fees?\n\nAccording to the protocol, the standard fee on all pools is 0.04%. Half of the fee goes to liquidity providers, the other half to veCRV holders. veCRV holders receive enhanced governance rights in return for [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) their tokens for fixed periods of time. \n\n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trade on Curve Finance?\n\nThis exchange offers only token swaps and thus does not have leverage or margin trading.

            "description": "## What Is Uniswap (V2)?\n\nUniswap is a [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) (DEX) which first introduced the [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) (AMM) model. Unlike with an [order book](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/order-book), traders are provided with constant liquidity thanks to the “constant product” formula. The V2 version was first based on [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), before branching out to other blockchains that support [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) tokens.\n\nWhile the V1 version of Uniswap only supported [swapping](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) ETH-ERC-20 token pairs, the V2 version did away with this bridging problem and introduced flash swaps. These allowed users to swap between different ERC-20 tokens without incurring too much [slippage](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/slippage). It also introduced protocol fees, which contributed to the platform's ongoing development. Furthermore, the V2 version began using [wrapped Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-wrapped-ethereum-weth) over native Ether for its core contracts. \n\nThe exchange’s popularity gave birth to a V3 version with concentrated liquidity and more flexible fees, which improved the user experience for traders and liquidity providers alike. \n\n\n## Who Is the Founder of Uniswap (V2)?\n\nHayden Adams, a former mechanical engineer at Siemens and Stony Brook University graduate, founded the platform in November 2018. The company behind the DEX raised a seed round from Paradigm and $11 million in a Series A round led by ​​Andreessen Horowitz.\n\n\n## When Did Uniswap (V2) Launch?\n\nUniswap’s V1 version was a proof-of-concept first launched in November 2018, and later improved with the introduction of the V2 version in August 2020. The V3 version in May 2021 marks the current final iteration of the exchange.\n\n\n## Where Is Uniswap (V2) Located?\n\nUniswap Labs, the company behind the decentralized exchange, is headquartered in New York City. \n\n\n## Uniswap (V2) Restricted Countries\n\nAs of July 2022, Uniswap has banned users from 10 countries that are sanctioned by the U.S. government, including Belarus, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Côte d'Ivoire, Liberia, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Iraq and Iran.\n\n\n## Uniswap (V2) Supported Coins List \n\nAs a permissionless decentralized exchange, tokens can be freely listed by anyone providing liquidity to trade them. The most liquid tokens at the time of writing include stablecoins and wrapped tokens like [USDC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/), [Wrapped BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wrapped-bitcoin/), [wETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/weth/) and [DAI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/). \n\n\n## How Much Are Uniswap (V2) Fees?\n\nThe exchange’s V2 version charges 0.3% per token swap. 0.05% goes to the protocol and 0.25% is allocated to [liquidity providers](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens).\n\n\n## Is It Possible to Use Leverage or Margin Trade on Uniswap (V2)?\n\nUniswap V2 does not offer leverage or margin trading.",

The platform enhances user experience by integrating token exchange and stablecoin exchange functionalities, while the destruction mechanism of its native token promotes the long-term value of the ecosystem.\n\nAs an ecosystem governed by DAO, SUN.io provides a secure exchange environment for the market. Users can take advantage of stablecoin pools for low slippage stablecoin exchanges, enjoy more favorable trading costs, or participate in governance mining programs to earn more attractive liquidity mining rewards.\n\nMoreover, SUN.io empowers users to gain governance rights by staking native tokens, allowing them to increase their influence in platform governance through long-term lock-ups. This mechanism encourages users' long-term participation and commitment to the platform.\n\nSunSwap V2, as the core of the SUN.io ecosystem, adopts a proprietary algorithm-based Automated Market Maker (AMM) model. With a constant product mathematical formula, SunSwap V2 ensures constant liquidity for all trading pairs, providing a stable trading environment for traders. Liquidity providers can share in transaction fees by filling liquidity pools, and SunSwap V2's multi-token trading pool design meets the different needs of traders, adding flexibility and appeal to the platform.\n\n## When Did SunSwap V2 Launch?\n\nAfter a comprehensive upgrade of the project and infrastructure improvements, SunSwap V2 was successfully launched in May 2021.\n\n## Where Is SUN.io Located?\n\nAs a decentralized exchange, SunSwap V2 allows team members to work remotely on a global scale.\n\n## SUN.io Restricted Countries\n\nPlease note that SunSwap V2 is currently not available for use in mainland China.\n\n## SUN.io Supported Coins List\n\nIt supports all TRC-20 tokens based on the TRON blockchain, providing users with a wide range of trading options.\n\n## How Much Are SunSwap V2 Fees?\n\nA 0.3% transaction fee is required for transactions on SunSwap V2, of which 0.05% is specifically used to buy back and burn the SUN token, thereby enhancing the value of the token.\n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trade on SUN.io?\n\nCurrently, SUN.io does not offer margin or leverage trading services, focusing on its core decentralized trading functions.",

            "description": "## What Is SushiSwap?\n\nSushiSwap is a decentralized exchange ([DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex)) that uses an [AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm). This automated market maker utilizes [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) to create markets for trading pairs of different tokens. [Liquidity providers ](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens)supply these smart contracts with capital and enable frictionless trading. The exchange was one of the earliest to adopt this model and was initially a [fork](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/fork-software) of UniSwap, another popular DEX. It later grew into one of the biggest exchanges in all of [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi) and is now available on almost all [EVM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm)-compatible [layer-one blockchains](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-1-blockchain) and several [layer-two](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-2) solutions for [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/). \n\nThe exchange targets mostly DeFi traders and institutions that want to enjoy [permissionless](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/permissionless) and [non-custodial](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-custodial) trading. It does away with liquidity issues and has a more egalitarian [governance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance) approach than other exchanges. Its native token can be used for voting on governance proposals.        \n\nIts core products include the Bento Box, a token vault that generates yield for the capital deposited into it. Kashi lending is a lending and [margin trading](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/margin-trading) platform where anyone can create customized and gas-efficient markets for tokens. MasterChef V2 is a liquidity provision program that contains over $1 billion, at the time of writing. Finally, Miso provides projects with access to trading on the exchange itself, either through fixed price or dutch auction options. \n\n\n## Who Are the SushiSwap Founders?\n\nSushiSwap was originally founded by Chef Nomi ([pseudonym](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/pseudonymous)). They later left the project and handed off its management to two other pseudonymous developers called sushiswap and 0xMaki. They developed the product and the business, before the ownership of the exchange was passed on to Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of FTX, a [centralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/centralized-exchange-cex). \n\n\n## When Did SushiSwap Launch?\n\nSushiSwap launched in August 2020. \n\n\n## Where Is SushiSwap Located?\n\nThe exchange does not have a central headquarter but operates in a decentralized manner instead.\n\n \n## SushiSwap Restricted Countries\n\nThere is no information about possibly blocked or restricted countries on this exchange. \n\n\n## SushiSwap Supported Coins List \n\nSushiSwap supports almost all [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) tokens on the market, thanks to its presence on several layer-one and layer-two blockchains.\n\n\n## How Much Are SushiSwap Fees?\n\nThe exchange charges the industry standard of 0.3% for token swaps.\n\n\n## Is It Possible to Use Leverage or Margin Trade on SushiSwap?\n\nSushiswap offers Kashi, a lending and margin trading platform that uses a unique [isolated market](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/isolated-margin) framework.",

            "description": "PancakeSwap is a decentralized exchange for swapping BEP20 tokens on Binance Smart Chain. PancakeSwap uses an automated market maker (AMM) model where users trade against a liquidity pool. Such pools are filled with users’ funds. They deposit them into the pool, receiving liquidity provider (or LP) tokens in return. They can use those tokens to reclaim their share, plus a portion of the trading fees. \n\nThe LP tokens are called FLIP tokens. PancakeSwap also allows users to farm additional tokens – CAKE and SYRUP. On the farm, users can deposit LP tokens, locking them up in a process that rewards users with CAKE.  Users can stake CAKE tokens to receive SYRUP, which will have further functionality as governance tokens (and as tickets in a lotteries).",

            "description": "## What Is Dodo (Ethereum)?\n\nDodo is an [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)-based [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) with a “proactive market maker,” a customized version of an automated market maker ([AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm)). Dodo provides a way to issue and trade digital assets on the blockchain. It provides both its own and aggregated liquidity from other exchanges, which, according to its whitepaper, allows the exchange to offer the best prices for Web3 assets anywhere. \n\nUsers can [swap](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) different tokens in a permissionless manner, either through [market orders](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/market-order-market-buy-market-sell) or [limit orders](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/limit-order). Dodo also offers gasless swap routes, which use professional market makers for deeper liquidity with zero slippage and gas fees. Furthermore, an [NFT](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) market enables the trading of [ERC-721](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-721) and [ERC-1155](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-1155) tokens. The [liquidity provider](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens) program is one of the ways to earn on the exchange, and users can add liquidity to receive LP tokens and earn a share of the trading fees. Another way is mining, where users engage either in single coin mining or LP market-making mining by adding funds to designated [liquidity pools](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool). There is also the option to borrow flash loans and deploy capital in a more efficient way.\n\nFinally, the exchange offers developers a tool to create tokens. Several blockchains like Ethereum, [BNB Chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/), [Polygon](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polygon/) and OKChain are supported.  \n\n\n## Who Are the Dodo Founders?\n\nAccording to Crunchbase, Dodo was founded by Qi Wang and Shichao Dai, two Chinese nationals. The DEX raised a total of $5 million from 17 different ventures, including Coinbase Ventures, Defiance Capital and Galaxy Digital.     \n\n\n## When Did Dodo Launch?\n\nDodo launched in August 2020.\n\n\n## Where Is Dodo Located?\n\nCrunchbase lists Hong Kong as the exchange’s headquarters.\n\n \n\n\n## Dodo Restricted Countries\n\nAt the time of writing, there is no information about restricted countries on this exchange.\n\n\n## Dodo Supported Coins List \n\nDodo has deployed on almost all [EVM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm)-compatible blockchains like [Arbitrum](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-arbitrum-the-ultimate-guide-to-the-arbitrum-ecosystem), [Optimism](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-optimism-the-ultimate-guide-to-the-optimism-ecosystem), [Avalanche](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/) and [Aurora](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aurora-near/). It thus supports a plethora of different tokens across all blockchains, including all major tokens, as well as [wrapped Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-wrapped-ethereum-weth) and [wrapped Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-wrapped-bitcoin). \n\n\n## How Much Are Dodo Fees?\n\nDodo charges a small usage fee for creating new tokens (0.02 ETH) but does not provide any information about trading fees. \n\n\n## Is It Possible to Use Leverage or Margin Trade on Dodo?\n\nThere is currently no option to margin trade, but the roadmap promises to introduce leverage trading in 2022.

            "description": "## What Is Honeyswap?\n\nHoneyswap is a replicated deployment of [UniSwap (V2)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/) on the [xDai](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xdaistable/) chain. xDai is an [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) [side chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/side-chain) with the same properties as Ethereum but a [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos) [consensus mechanism](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus-mechanism). That allows validators to verify blocks every five seconds, minimizing transaction fees in the process. UniSwap is the most popular [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) (DEX) on Ethereum, and pioneered the [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) (AMM) model .\n\nThe exchange is governed by the 1hive community, using the [HNY](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/honey-hive-investments/) token. It functions as an automated liquidity protocol with a constant product formula. As is the case for UniSwap, anyone can become a [liquidity provider](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens) by depositing tokens in the [liquidity pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool) and receiving LP tokens in return. Traders can [swap](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) tokens and developers can build integrations with the [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract), using them as so-called “money legos.” \n\nThe community is divided into different “swarms,” which build around different project initiatives. The [DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) itself enables [flash loans](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/flash-loan), [oracles](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/oracles) and token swaps. To use the exchange, users have to [bridge](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/bridges) their ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum to xDai. \n\n\n## Who Are the Honeyswap Founders?\n\nHoneyswap is governed by a [DAO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao) in a decentralized and censorship-resistant manner. The [Honey token](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/honey-hive-investments/) is used to vote on [governance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance) proposals. The 1Hive protocol, which is the foundation of the decentralized exchange, is based on software built by Aragon. Aragon provides open-source infrastructure to DAOs and was founded by the Aragon Association, a Switzerland-based non-profit entity.\n\n\n## When Did Honeyswap Launch?\n\nHoneyswap launched in September 2020.\n\n\n## Where Is Honeyswap Located?\n\nSince the DEX is governed by a DAO, it has no central location but is managed in a decentralized fashion. \n\n \n\n\n## Honeyswap Restricted Countries\n\nThere are no formal restrictions on a decentralized exchange like Honeyswap. However, users from countries sanctioned by the US government can be sanctioned. These include Cuba, Iran, Zimbabwe, Iraq, Crimea, Syria, Sudan, Belarus and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\n\n## Honeyswap Supported Coins List \n\nAs a fork of UniSwap (V2), [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) tokens are supported. \n\n\n## How Much Are Honeyswap Fees?\n\nHoneyswap charges a 0.3% fee for token swaps. 0.25% is redistributed to liquidity providers proportional to their stake in the liquidity pool and 0.05% is a protocol fee going to the exchange itself.  \n\n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trade on Honeyswap?\n\nThere is no leverage or margin trading on this exchange.

It’s responsible for helping the Celo Dollar (cUSD) maintain its peg to the USD. When demand for the stablecoin increases the Celo protocol mints cUSD and ‘sells’ them for CELO (Celo’s native asset) via Mento. The CELO assets are used as cUSD collateral and are stored in the Celo reserve.  This all happens on-chain. If demand for cUSD decreases then the reverse process happens. Mento arbitrage opportunities arise in cases where there’s cUSD/USD depeg. This incentive for traders should help restore the cUSD/USD peg. \r\n\r\nMore info here: https://medium.com/celoorg/zooming-in-on-the-celo-expansion-contraction-mechanism-446ca7abe4f",

            "description": "## What Is KLAYswap?\n\n[Klayswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/klayswap-protocol/) is a complete on-chain instant swap protocol. It offers an on-chain [liquidity pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool) powered by an automated market maker ([AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm)). Its main value proposition is offering anyone with a KCT-type token to become a [liquidity provider](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens) and earn income from transaction fee commissions. The exchange enables [token swaps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) from [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) to the Klaytn ecosystem via its Orbit Bridge, an IBC bridge built on the Orbit chain, which is a part of the [Cosmos](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cosmos/) ecosystem. \n\nIn KLAYswap, Ethereum-based tokens (ETH, ORC, DAI, WBTC) can be transferred to the Klaytn ecosystem via Orbit Bridge, a transparent IBC bridge, built on Orbit Chain, to offer yield farming with asset pairings previously unconnected in the decentralized world\n\nUsers can provide liquidity by matching KLAY-KCT pairs with the token contracts created in the exchange’s pool menu. With the LP tokens, they receive a share of the trading fees generated by the token pair. Any token listed in the protocol is available for trading. The price depends on the number of pairs of the respective tokens. \n\nFurthermore, the [governance token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance-token) allows users to participate in improvement proposals and to pay for a KCT token pool contract creation fee. Tokens can be acquired through a process called [liquidity mining](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-mining). \n\nVarious people can participate in the KLAYswap ecosystem, including long-term investors who want to hold cryptocurrency for a long time, investors who want to earn income through commission fees, and miners who want to take part in governance through KSP mining. Token holders can influence the governance of the DEX and vote on fees, mining distributions, and deploying new [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract). The token can also be used to pay the pool creation fee for founding a new liquidity pool on the exchange.\n\n\n## Who Are the KLAYswap Founders?\n\nAs a trustless on-chain swap protocol, Klayswap has no founder or CEO leading the exchange. Instead, anyone that wants to participate in the decentralized and trustless swapping of tokens between KCT tokens and other standards can participate in its [governance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance). \n\n\n## When Did KLAYswap Launch?\n\nKlayswap launched in January 2021.\n\n\n## Where Is KLAYswap Located?\n\nThere is no headquarter since the exchange works in a decentralized way. \n\n \n\n\n## KLAYswap Restricted Countries\n\nAt the time of writing, there is no information about restricted countries on this exchange.\n\n\n## KLAYswap Supported Coins List \n\nThe exchange supports all tokens that adhere to the KCT token standard, such as [KSP](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/klayswap-protocol/) and [KLAY](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/klaytn/).\n\n\n## How Much Are KLAYswap Fees?\n\nAt the time of writing, token swaps incur an industry-standard 0.3% fee both for makers and  takers. Fees can be changed by community governance.\n\n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trade on KLAYswap?\n\nKlayswap does not offer [leverage](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/leverage) or [margin trading](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/margin-trading).\n\n##Who participates in KLAYswap? \n\nKLAyswap participants include liquidity providers and traders.  You can provide liquidity by matching KLAY-KCT pairs with the token contracts created in KLAYswap’s Pool Menu. If providing liquidity, you will receive a Liquidity Provider (LP) token as a supply certificate. You will receive a reward share of the fees from that respective pool as a contribution reward. Tokens listed in the protocol can be traded with KLAY or KCT within the scope of the respective pool. The transaction price is based on the existent number of pairs of the respective tokens.\n\nKLAYswap, as a trustless on-chain swap protocol, is a service created by all participants (liquidity providers, traders, and community members) and not by a particular operator. With this and the decentralized, trustless philosophy of blockchain in mind, KLAYswap issued the KSP (KLAYswap Protocol) governance token so participants can create KLAYswap’s policies and direction and lead to the gradual, continued development of the service.\n\n##Yield Farming on KLAYswap and getting the KSP token\n\nWith the KSP governance token, KLAYswap is officially owned by all participants and allows participants to obtain their own continuity of service. KLAYswap, valuing the principle of neutrality and trustlessness, limits the role of KSP to contributing to the development of protocols and the development of service ecosystems so that the protocol’s governance can be strictly observed. KSP has the main utilities of governance voting and paying for a KCT token pool contract creation fee. \n\nIn KLAYswap, a complete on-chain instant swap protocol, traders can not only experience immediate transactions via liquidity pools, but also develop services by deciding the policy and direction of KLAYswap with the KSP governance token.\n\nIn addition, users can receive various forms of compensation, including transaction fee revenue, for contributing to the growth of the protocol. Various people can participate in the KLAYswap ecosystem, including long-term investors who want to hold cryptocurrency for a long time, investors who want to earn income through commission fees, and miners who want to participate in KLAYswap governance through KSP mining.",

            "description": "Venus is an algorithmic-based money market system designed to bring a complete decentralized finance-based lending and credit system onto Binance Smart Chain. Venus enables users to utilize their cryptocurrencies by supplying collateral to the network that may be borrowed by pledging over-collateralized cryptocurrencies. This creates a secure lending environment where the lender receives a compounded interest rate annually (APY) paid per block, while the borrower pays interest on the cryptocurrency borrowed. These interest rates are set by the protocol in a curve yield, where the rates are automated based on the demand of the specific market, such as Bitcoin. The difference of Venus from other money market protocols is the ability to use the collateral supplied to the market not only to borrow other assets but also to mint synthetic stablecoins with over-collateralized positions that protect the protocol. These synthetic stablecoins are not backed by a basket of fiat currencies but by a basket of cryptocurrencies. Venus utilizes the Binance Smart chain for fast, low-cost transactions while accessing a deep network of wrapped tokens and liquidity.",

            "description": "## What Is Blockchain.com?\n\nBlockchain.com is one of the early pioneers of key infrastructure for the Bitcoin community. It is associated with various projects: Blockchain Explorer that allows anyone to examine transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, a robust API for companies that wish to build on Bitcoin, and its popular crypto wallet. Since its launch in 2011, the company has transacted over $1 trillion in crypto.\n\nInterestingly, about one-third of all Bitcoin network transactions are via Blockchain.com. As of October 2022, the company had about 37 million verified users who created more than 80 million wallets.\n\n\n## Who Are the Founders of Blockchain.com?\n\nFormerly known as Blockchain.info, the cryptocurrency financial services company began its operations as a Bitcoin blockchain explorer. It was founded in August 2011. Benjamin Reeves_, _Nicolas Cary, and Peter Smith were among the people who developed its core projects.\n\nPrior to creating the website for tracking Bitcoin transactions, Reeves obtained a bachelor’s degree in Business Administration, Management, and Operations at Newcastle-upon-Tyne University in 2009. He went on to achieve a first-class Master’s degree in Computer Science and became a mobile developer at Engine Room Apps in 2010. He was also the CEO of Qkos Services Ltd, a software development company that dissolved in 2014.\n\nAs for Cary, he studied Business at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Washington, between 2003 and 2007 before working as a partner and manager of customer operations at PipelineDeals until 2013. Meanwhile, Smith obtained a degree from the University of London and has been part of the UK Finance board. \n\n\n## When Did Blockchain.com Launch?\n\nBitcoin blockchain explorer launched in August 2011. But it wasn’t until July 2019 that the firm launched its cryptocurrency exchange.\n\n\n## Where Is Blockchain.com Located?\n\nBlockchain.com has its primary headquarters in London, with other branches in Lithuania and United States. \n\n\n## Blockchain.com Restricted Countries\n\nAlthough the crypto exchange supports many countries across the globe, there are a few restricted regions due to international and local financial/cryptocurrency regulations. People residing in Afghanistan, Barbados, Belarus, Burundi, Cambodia, the United States, and 28 other regions can not use its services.\n\n\n## What Coins Are Supported on Blockchain.com?\n\nAs of 2022, a list of the company’s support page showed that the exchange offers 31 digital assets.\n\n\n## How Much Are Blockchain.com Fees?\n\nBlockchain.com offers a tiered fee structure based on a 30-day trading volume. Maker fees range from 0% to 0.20%, and taker fees are between 0.06% and 0.40%.\n\n\n## Is It Possible to Use Leverage or Margin Trading on Blockchain.com?\n\nThe platform supports 5X margin trading on a few USD and USDT pairs for verified users in particular jurisdictions. It is not available in the US, Canada, Japan, Germany, The Netherlands, Italy and countries on the sanctions list.",

            "description": "## What Is OpenOcean?\n\n[OpenOcean](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/openocean/) is a [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) (DEX) aggregator. It sources liquidity from different [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi) markets and facilitates [cross-chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/cross-chain) swaps. Thanks to its routing algorithm, the aggregator finds the most attractive prices from various exchanges and provides traders with low [slippage](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/slippage) and fast [settlement](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/settlement). Since the aggregator is free of charge, users only pay the gas and exchange fees on the respective blockchains, though nothing to OpenOcean itself.\n\nThe protocol collects data from major decentralized and [centralized exchanges](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/centralized-exchange-cex). It also sources liquidity from [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) and [layer-two](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-2) solutions like [Arbitrum](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-arbitrum-the-ultimate-guide-to-the-arbitrum-ecosystem) and [Optimism](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-optimism-the-ultimate-guide-to-the-optimism-ecosystem), as well as other blockchains like [BNB Chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/), [Polygon](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polygon/), [Avalanche](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/), [Solana](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/), and others. The protocol continues expanding to other chains to meet the needs of its community. Users can place [limit orders](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/limit-order) and engage in [liquidity providing](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens).\n\nMoreover, it aggregates [derivative](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/derivative) products and aims to release its wealth management services. An API and [arbitrage](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/arbitrage) tools serve for automated trading strategies. The exchange’s vision is to build a crypto-only trading aggregator with increased capital efficiency, connecting the currently fragmented DeFi and CeFi markets. This shall allow each investor (despite their size or affiliation) to trade at the best prices and apply their investment strategies across the cryptocurrency markets. A future SaaS tool will provide automated arbitrage strategies and grid trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges to achieve that goal.\n\n\n## Who Are the OpenOcean Founders?\n\nThe OpenOcean founders are anonymous and work according to the decentralized ethos of the exchange, which is open-source and has been [audited](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/audit) by security firms like Certik.\n\n\n## When Did OpenOcean Launch?\n\nOpenOcean launched in July 2021.\n\n\n## Where Is OpenOcean Located?\n\nWith no centralized leadership heading the project, there is no headquarter or central location from where the exchange operates. \n\n\n## OpenOcean Restricted Countries\n\nAt the time of writing, there is no information about restricted countries on this exchange. \n\n\n## OpenOcean Supported Coins List \n\nOpenOcean has integrated more than 16 blockchains and includes [EVM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm)-compatible and non-EVM-compatible chains. It thus supports almost all relevant cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n## How Much Are OpenOcean Fees?\n\nThere are no fees on this exchange. Users only have to pay the gas fees and exchange fees from the different platforms used by the aggregator. For token swaps through the liquidity pools, a flat 0.2% fee is charged, with 0.15% going to liquidity providers and 0.05% to the treasury.\n\n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trade on OpenOcean?\n\nOpenOcean does not offer [leverage](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/leverage) or [margin trading](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/margin-trading).",

Its [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) integrates upgradeable [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) on [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) and renders [intermediaries](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/intermediary-middleman) obsolete. The exchange is based on open-source software and prioritizes decentralization, [censorship resistance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/censorship-resistance) and security. It benefits from ultra-low gas prices compared to Ethereum, as well as fast and simple trading execution.    \n\nAnyone can become a [liquidity provider](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens) by depositing two tokens into a [liquidity pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool). The exchange enables the trading of [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) tokens, which are traded according to the constant product formula. The mechanism removes the need for an [order book](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/order-book) and allows traders to tap into a constant pool of liquidity. \n\nLiquidity providers can passively invest their assets to accumulate trading fees or provide liquidity as a hedge for certain trading strategies. Traders use tools like [token swaps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) or can deploy arbitrage bots to compare prices across different exchanges. Finally, developers integrate the exchange with different liquidity aggregators or [wallets](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/hot-wallet).\n\n\n## Who Are the QuickSwap Founders?\n\nQuickSwap was founded by Roc Zacharias, who is also the CEO of Lunar Digital Assets, a blockchain marketing and consultancy firm that also acts as an advisor to the exchange. It is furthermore advised by the Matic Foundation, a governing body of the Polygon blockchain. \n\n\n## When Did QuickSwap Launch?\n\nQuickSwap launched in May 2021 with over 96% of the tokens distributed to the community. It is now considered the main decentralized exchange for Polygon, a [layer-two](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-2) solution for Ethereum. \n\n\n## Where Is QuickSwap Located?\n\nThe exchange doesn’t provide any information about its headquarters.\n\n \n\n\n## QuickSwap Restricted Countries\n\nAt the time of writing, there is no information about restricted countries on this exchange.\n\n\n## QuickSwap Supported Coins List \n\nQuickSwap supports all ERC-20 tokens deployed on Polygon, including wrapped tokens like [wrapped Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-wrapped-bitcoin). \n\n\n## How Much Are QuickSwap Fees?\n\nThe exchange charges a 0.3% fee for swapping tokens, which is distributed among liquidity providers on a pro-rata basis. \n\n\n## Is It Possible to Use Leverage or Margin Trade on QuickSwap?\n\nThere is no margin or [leverage trading](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-leverage-in-crypto-trading-and-how-to-use-it) option on this exchange.

            "description": "Swop.fi is an automated market maker (AMM) that offers different pricing formulas that are most suitable for each specific token pair. The original Flat formula is designed to reduce slippage in a pair of stable coins pegged to the same fiat currency. The classic Constant Product Market Maker formula is used for other pairs.\r\n\r\nSwop.fi stakes a portion of pools’ liquidity, and daily payouts are included in pools, adding another 5–50% APY to liquidity providers' income on top of trading fees. Swop.fi also rewards liquidity providers in SWOP, the protocol's governance token.\r\n\r\nSwop.fi is based on the Waves blockchain, ensuring that transactions can be added to the blockchain in just a few seconds and the network fee for a smart contract invocation is only 0.005 WAVES (a few cents).",

            "description": "## What Is Perpetual Protocol?\n\nPerpetual Protocol is a [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) (DEX) for trading perpetual [futures](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/futures) — V1 was initially launched on [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) scaling solution [xDai](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xdaistable/), while V2 launched on Ethereum [layer-2](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-2) (L2) scaling solution [Optimism](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/optimism-ethereum/). The exchange also plans to add other [EVM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm)-compatible blockchains in the near future. Users can trade a variety of assets with leverage up to 10X and go long or short on them. With the [non-custodial](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-custodial) nature of the exchange, traders retain possession of their assets and can execute trades directly from their wallets. \n\nThe vAMM (virtual [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm)) provides [on-chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/on-chain) [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity) by offering predictable pricing through a constant product curve. The vAMM is designed to be market-neutral and fully collateralized. V2 integrates with [Uniswap V3](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v3/) to allow [liquidity providers](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider) to choose where along the price curve to provide liquidity.\n\nThe exchange’s goal is to become the most secure, most accessible and most decentralized derivatives trading platform and embrace the ethos of “[DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi) money legos.” To achieve this goal, it has already launched [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) pools, expanded to several blockchains, and introduced [limit orders](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/limit-order) and [stop-loss orders](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/stop-loss-order). It further plans to introduce leveraged tokens and launch dynamic liquidity pools for more efficient trade execution.      \n\n\n## Who Are the Perpetual Protocol Founders?\n\nYenfen Weng and Shao-Kang Lee, two crypto entrepreneurs from Taiwan, launched Perpetual Protocol. Prior to that, they had founded accounting companies for crypto startups. The exchange is backed by CMS Holdings, Binance Labs, Alameda Research and Zee Prime Capital, and closed a seed round for $1.8 million in 2020.\n\n\n## When Did Perpetual Protocol Launch?\n\nPerpetual Protocol launched in September 2020.\n\n\n## Where Is Perpetual Protocol Located?\n\nThe core team is based in Taiwan.\n\n \n\n\n## Perpetual Protocol Restricted Countries\n\nPerpetual Protocol restricts several countries: Taiwan, the United Kingdom, Antigua and Barbuda, Algeria, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Belarus, Burundi, Myanmar (Burma), Cote D'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), Crimea and Sevastopol, Cuba, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, Morocco, Liberia, Nepal, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Zimbabwe.\n\n\n## Perpetual Protocol Supported Coins List \n\nPerpetual Protocol supports futures trading of several big cryptocurrencies like [BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/), [ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), [ATOM](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cosmos/), [AVAX](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/), [FTM](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/fantom/), [BNB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bnb/) and others.\n\n\n## How Much Are Perpetual Protocol Fees?\n\nThe exchange charges a 0.10% maker and taker fee. Fees are settled in ETH and stablecoins such as DAI and USDC.\n\n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trade on Perpetual Protocol?\n\nIt is possible to use up to 10X leverage for non-custodial trading on this exchange.",

It employs a custom-made automated market maker ([AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm)), which enables simple trading and issuance of digital assets. Besides aggregating liquidity from other decentralized exchanges, it provides its own liquidity through [liquidity providers](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens). The exchange’s [whitepaper](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/whitepaper) claims that it offers the best prices for [web3](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/web-3-0) assets anywhere. \n\nThe easy and [permissionless](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/permissionless) [swapping](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) of different tokens with [market orders](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/market-order-market-buy-market-sell) or [limit orders](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/limit-order) is accomplished through gasless swap routes that use professional market makers for deeper liquidity with zero [slippage](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/slippage) and gas fees. An [NFT](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) market allows users to trade [ERC-721](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-721) and [ERC-1155](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-1155) tokens. Moreover, the [liquidity provider](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens) program is one of the ways to earn on the exchange.

            "description": "## What Is Raydium?\n\n[Raydium](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/raydium/) is a [Solana](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/)-based [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) (DEX) with an [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) (AMM) model. Users can [swap](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap), trade, and become [liquidity providers](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens). The exchange provides liquidity to [Serum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/serum/), another Solana-based exchange with a central [order book](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/order-book) model. Therefore, Raydium users can access the order flow and liquidity of Serum and vice versa. Furthermore, the platform claims to offer the best price swap feature that automatically determines whether a token swap is cheaper if routed through the [liquidity pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool) or the Serum order book. \n\nUsers can also add liquidity and receive LP tokens, which represent a proportional share of the pooled assets. Every time a token swap is performed, LP token holders receive 0.22% of the trade volume. It is distributed according to the proportion of liquidity provided to the pool. There is also an option to create permissionless pools, which will also place orders on the Serum order book. This way, users can add any token pairs they wish and earn a share of the trading fees. \n\nThe native [RAY](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/raydium/) token can be staked to earn additional tokens. It also serves as a [governance token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance-token) that can be used to vote on improvement proposals and fee structures on the exchange.  \n\n\n## Who Are the Raydium Founders?\n\nAlphaRay leads overall strategy, operations, product direction and business development for Raydium. With a background in algorithmic trading in commodities, Alpha transitioned to market making and liquidity providing for cryptocurrency in 2017 and hasn't looked back. After diving into DeFi in the summer of 2020, Alpha saw a market need for an order book AMM to aggregate liquidity, and with the release of Serum, pulled together a team of experienced trading developers to tackle the problem head on.\nXRay is Raydium's Chief of Technology and Dev Team leader. X has 8 years of experience as a trading and low latency systems architect for both traditional and crypto markets. X designs all of Raydium’s systems and infrastructure as needed.\nGammaRay heads up marketing and communications while also playing a key role in strategy and product direction. Gamma spent a large part of his career at a leading data analytics and market research firm, working on both client engagements and corporate marketing. Prior to Raydium, Gamma's focus within cryptocurrency has been technical analysis and discretionary trading.\n\n## When Did Raydium Launch?\n\nRaydium launched on February 21, 2022. \n\n\n## Where Is Raydium Located?\n\nThe exchange does not list its location on its Crunchbase profile. \n\n\n## Raydium Restricted Countries\n\nThe Raydium Protocol is not available to residents of Belarus, The Central African Republic, The Democratic Republic of Congo, North Korea, Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, Cuba, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria, the US, Yemen, Zimbabwe and any other jurisdiction in which accessing or using the protocol is prohibited.\n\n\n## Raydium Supported Coins List \n\nRaydium supports all Solana-based SPL tokens. \n\n\n## How Much Are Raydium Fees?\n\nAt the time of writing, token swaps incur a 0.25% trading fee, with 0.22% returned to the liquidity pools as a fee reward and 0.03% distributed to the staking pool.\n\n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trade on Raydium?\n\nRaydium does not offer [leverage](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/leverage) or [margin trading](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/margin-trading).",

The token can be [staked](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) in so-called ‘Syrup Pools’ with flexible or fixed-term staking. Flexible staking allows users to unstake at any time, while fixed-term staking maximizes yield and locks up tokens for up to 52 weeks.\n\nFurthermore, PancakeSwap (V2) offers a lottery, where users can win prizes in CAKE.

            "description": "## What Is Uniswap?\n\nUniswap is one of the most popular cryptocurrency [decentralized exchanges](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) (DEXs), launching in November 2018. It pioneered the [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) (AMM) model, instead of the traditional order book-based used by exchanges. Uniswap runs on the Ethereum blockchain and uses a number of [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) to securely swap [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) tokens between users.\n\nThe decentralized aspect of the protocol means that there is no single centralized authority that manages and runs the exchange — instead, swaps are done in a [peer-to-peer](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/peer-to-peer-p2p) (P2P) manner. Moreover, Uniswap strives to solve the [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity) problem inherent in other exchanges. Uniswap V3 is the 3rd edition of the protocol fitted with updates to improve compensation and provide greater control and flexibility for individual LPs. Uniswap V3 supports over 46.5% of the total DEX trading volume and the protocol reached a cumulative lifetime trading volume of $1 trillion in May 2022.\n\n## Who Is the Founder of Uniswap V3\n\nUniswap was founded by Hayden Adams, a graduate of Stony Brook University and a former mechanical engineer at Siemens. Inspired by a blog and Reddit post by Vitalik Buterin, Adams received a grant from the Ethereum Foundation and launched the protocol in November 2018. Uniswap Labs raised a seed round from Paradigm and, in August 2020, received $11 million in its Series A round led by ​​Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nUniswap V3 launched in May of 2021, almost 2.5 years after the first version was released, and a year after Uniswap V2 was launched. \n\n\n## Where Is Uniswap Located?\n\nThe Uniswap protocol and Uniswap interface were developed by Uniswap Labs, which is located in New York City. As a[ decentralized finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi) (DeFi) protocol, it can be used worldwide by anyone with internet access. However, there are some restrictions depending on what country you are from. As of July 2022, Uniswap has banned 10 countries from its protocol. The list of countries includes Belarus, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Côte D'ivoire, Liberia, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Iraq and Iran.\n\n## What Coins Can Be Traded on Uniswap?\n\nAs a decentralized peer-to-peer protocol, anyone can list a token on Uniswap. The most popular trading pairs at the time of writing include [USDC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/), [Wrapped BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wrapped-bitcoin/), [WETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/weth/) and [DAI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/). \n\n## How Much Are Uniswap V3 Fees?\n\nUniswap V3 liquidity providers can initially create liquidity pools at three fee levels: 0.05%, 0.30% and 1%. More fee levels may be added through the UNI governance proposal. \n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trading on Uniswap?\n\nUniswap V3 does not offer leverage or margin trading directly on its platform.",

            "description": "## What Is ViperSwap?\r\n\r\nViperSwap is an automated market maker (AMM), a decentralized exchange (DEX) and DeFi protocol that allows users to exchange tokens, provide liquidity and earn trading fees.\r\n\r\nThe DEX launched March 8th, 2021 and runs on Harmony's blockchain - making it one of the fastest and cheapest DEX:es in existence.\r\n\r\nViperSwap is based on a mashup of Uniswap and SushiSwap smart contracts and features an automated market maker model where users trade against liquidity pools.\r\n\r\nThe pool liquidity is deposited by users who want to earn trading fees as well as staking rewards for providing the liquidity. After depositing funds the users earn a liquidity provider (LP) token called VENOM-LP which can be staked to earn additional rewards besides trading fees.\r\n\r\nThe LP token is also used by users to reclaim their initial provided capital plus earned trading fees.\r\n\r\n## What Makes ViperSwap Unique?\r\n\r\nViperSwap takes advantage of Harmony's 2-second finality and extremely low transaction fees to offer one of the fastest and cheapest DEX:es in existence right now.\r\n\r\nA regular swap transaction on ViperSwap typically costs around $0.0000000015 - making the platform a viable option for everyone since users don't have to pay $10, $20 or even $100 to perform a single swap.\r\n\r\nViperSwap is governed by the VIPER governance token which is HRC-20 token awarded to liquidity providers staking their LP tokens on the platform.\r\n\r\nThe VIPER token features a unique lockup system designed to incentivize long-term protocol participation with the explicit goal of rewarding early and loyal liquidity providers. The token is used for both protocol governance as well as incentivizing liquidity providers.\r\n\r\nSwaps on ViperSwap follow a similar fee model as Uniswap and Sushiswap: every trade carries a 0.3% fee.\r\n\r\nViperSwap features a fee-sharing system called the \"ViperPit\" where 0.1% of the 0.3% fee (1/3rd) is distributed to users staking the VIPER token in the ViperPit single-asset staking pool. This is 50% more than what is awarded to stakers in e.g. SushiSwap (which rewards stakers with 1/6th of trading fees).\r\n\r\nIn summary:\r\n\r\n* Super fast DEX\r\n* Insanely low swap fees (as low as $0.0000000015!)\r\n* Attractive fee sharing mechanism rewarding singe-asset stakers 1/3rd of all generated trading fees",

            "description": "## What Is ShibaSwap?\n\n[ShibaSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/shibaswap/) is the [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/de/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) of the Shiba Inu ([SHIB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/)) coin, a popular dog-themed meme coin inspired by the success of Dogecoin and claiming to be a “[Dogecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/) killer.” In November 2021, Shiba Inu briefly surpassed Dogecoin in market capitalization, partly thanks to the DEX. \n\nShibaSwap enables users to provide liquidity and swap different tokens while earning its governance token [BONE](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bone-shibaswap/). Users can also trade NFTs, so-called “Shibatoshis,” a collection of 10,000 unique tokens related to the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Other functionalities include [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking), [swapping](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) tokens, collecting rewards, and checking portfolio analytics.\n\n### Who Are the Founders of ShibaSwap?\n\nAfter burning half of its supply to Vitalik Buterin, who then donated his tokens to charity, the Shiba Inu community decided that SHIB would need to set itself apart from other meme coins and started working on ShibaSwap. \n\nSince the founder of Shiba Inu is unknown, the same is true for ShibaSwap. The Shiba Inu community developed the exchange to increase the utility of the SHIB token. Shiba Inu was created in August 2020 by “Ryoshi,” a pseudonymous developer. Shiba Inu’s “Woofpaper” explains three reasons for the creation of Shiba Inu: \n\n* “We started from zero, with zero.”\n* “The brilliant minds behind Shib had never collaborated before.”\n* “We love Shiba Inu Dogs.”\n\n### When Was ShibaSwap Launched?\n\nShibaSwap launched on July 6, 2021, to make the cryptocurrency more than a meme coin.\n\n### Where Is ShibaSwap Located?\n\nLike its founder, the location of the exchange remains a mystery.\n\n### ShibaSwap Restricted Countries\n\nThe platform is supposedly open to users from all over the world.\n\n### What Coins Are Supported on ShibaSwap?\n\nIn addition to SHIB, LEASH, and BONE, users can swap hundreds of other tokens on the DEX. There are over 230 markets, with the most popular trading pairs being ETH/VEMP, BONE/ETH, and SHIB/ETH.\n\n### How Much Are ShibaSwap Fees?\n\nTraders pay [gas fees](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/gas) on the Ethereum network to trade on ShibaSwap.\n\n### Is it Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trading on ShibaSwap?\n\nMargin trading is not enabled on the decentralized exchange.",

            "description": "## What Is Uniswap (V3) (Optimism)?\n\nUniswap is the largest decentralized trading and automated market-making protocol on Ethereum. Uniswap (V3) (Optimism) is the third iteration of the decentralized cryptocurrency exchange ([DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex)). The platform introduced the concept of [concentrated liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/concentrated-liquidity), which improves the liquidity providing efficiency and makes it easier for some assets to gain exposure. \n\nLiquidity providers (LPs) can also choose where and how they allocate their funds. Notably, LPs can supposedly earn higher rewards on their capital by providing liquidity with up to 4000x capital efficiency relative to Uniswap v2.\n\nAlthough Uniswap V3 is an update to previous versions, users can still trade on [Uniswap V2](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/).\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Uniswap (V3) (Optimism)?\n\nThe decentralized exchange was launched by Uniswap Labs, founded by Hayden Adams.\n\nAdams was an engineer at Siemens. He obtained a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from Stony Brook University in 2016. After leaving Siemens in July 2017, he created the Uniswap protocol in October 2017.\n\n### When Was Uniswap (V3) (Optimism) Launched?\n\nThe Alpha launch of Uniswap v3 on the Optimism Ethereum mainnet was announced on July 13, 2021.\n\n### Where Is Uniswap (V3) (Optimism) Located?\n\nThe company has its headquarters in New York.\n\n### Uniswap (V3) (Optimism) Restricted Countries\n\nThe platform is restricted in countries subject to US sanctions, including Syria, Iran, and Belarus.\n\n### What Coins Are Supported on Uniswap (V3) (Optimism)?\n\nUniswap (V3) (Optimism) currently has 20 cryptocurrencies, zero fiat currencies, and 115 crypto trading pairs.\n\n### How Much Are Uniswap (V3) (Optimism) Fees?\n\nThe DEX has a multi-tier fee structure that compensates liquidity providers based on the risk level of their investment. There are three fee categories – 0.05%, 0.30%, and 1%. The fee is based on the volatility of the trading pair. For instance, non-correlated pairs may attract a fee of 0.3% or 1% because they are generally riskier.\n\n### Is it Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trading on Uniswap (V3) (Optimism)?\n\nUniswap (V3) (Optimism) is primarily a DEX for swapping assets. As such, it does not support margin trading.",

            "description": "## What Is Orca?\n\nOrca touts itself as the \"easiest, fastest, and most user-friendly cryptocurrency exchange on the Solana blockchain.\" Being one of the first automated [market makers](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-automated-market-makers) (AMM) launched on [Solana](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/solana), the decentralized exchange (DEX) maintains its own [liquidity pools](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool). It allows users to swap assets, participate in yield farming, and provide liquidity.\n\nThe platform leverages Solana’s quick transactions and low fees. On one hand, users can perform low-fee token trades. On the other, they can provide [concentrated liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/concentrated-liquidity) to the platform to earn a share of trading fees.\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Orca?\n\nOrca was co-founded by Grace Kwan and Yutaro Mori. Kwan, aka \"Ori,\" is the UX designer. She graduated from Stanford with a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science before working as a software engineer at Coursera and a designer at IDEO.\n\nYutaro is the brain behind Orca's core AMM. He has been active in the crypto space since 2017 at the Ethereum Foundation. He worked on the Eth2 Go client and Layer 2 solutions before making a foray into Solana.\n\n### When Was Orca Launched?\n\nThe project launched in February 2021 without external funding. In September 2021, the [total value locked](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/total-value-locked-tvl) (TVL) on the protocol had exceeded $300 million, while its trade volume exceeded $700 million.\n\n### Where Is Orca Located?\n\nThe company is located in New York, United States.\n\n### Orca Restricted Countries\n\nAlthough Orca’s \"Terms of Use Agreement\" did not explicitly name any country as restricted, the company advised users in areas prohibited by the applicable law to desist from using its platform.\n\n### What Coins Are Supported on Orca?\n\nThe DEX supports over 200 markets, with the most popular trading pairs being SOL/USDC, SOL/STSOL, and SOL/MSOL.\n\n### How Much Are Orca Fees?\n\nTrading fees vary depending on the route the AMM uses. The fee structure on the platform is as follows: stable whirlpool – 0.01%, whirlpool – 0.2%, stable pool – 0.07%, and pool – 0.3%. A \"double-hop trade\" such as SOL to USDT to ETH would pay 0.3% to trade SOL to USDT and another 0.3% to trade USDT to ETH.\n\n### Is it Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trading on Orca?\n\nThe decentralized trading platform does not support margin trading.",

            "description": "What is KSwap Finance (KST) \r\n\r\nKSwap Finance (https://kswap.finance) is a decentralized trading platform deployed on OKExChain on July 29, 2021.  Aiming at a top DEX on OKExChain, KSwap Finance enables the seamless transferring of digital currencies among users via a well-developed automatic maker algorithm (AMM). It is also the first to launch products such as KUniverse and KStarter to explore more ways to play and meet the needs of more users.\r\n\r\nKSwap Finance always attaches particular high importance to platform security and functionalities. Its products have been demonstrated to be well-functioned on the test net. Since its launch on the test net as early as February (2021), KSwap Finance has drawn heightened interests from blockchain communities. Only in April, KSwap grows terrifically, with an over 500% increase in total liquidity. An increasing influx of users has chosen to test various mature and new features on Kswap Finance to be better positioned for the official reception of OkExChain.\r\n\r\nWhat makes KSwap Finance different from other AMM-based decentralized changes? \r\n\r\nKSwap Finance is integrated with a marketplace for celestial body-themed non-fungible tokens (NFT), KUniverse. Unlike traditional NFTs that only have collector and game values, KUniverse deeply integrates KSwap's trading and bonus mechanisms, allowing KUniverse NFT holders to participate in a fixed bonus pool for KSwap's transaction fees to receive rewards. \r\n\r\nKUniverse issues a total of 20,000 mystery boxes in which there is a card representing celestial bodies such as Earth, Mars, etc. However, these celestial-themed cards are not equally distributed. Cards featuring different celestial bodies are assigned one of the seven levels of weights. Cards with higher weights are more scarce, and therefore more valuable than those with lower ranks. \r\nTrading in the marketplace. A user may trade his/her NFT assets with different NFT cards by selling in the market. This comes with a great level of flexibility, meaning a user may set whatever price he/she deems reasonable.\r\n\r\nStaking for rewards. KSwap Finance will dedicate a significant amount of the total supply of the KST into a dividend pool. In order to reap as high KST rewards as possible, a user may want to stake NFT cards with higher weights. The weights are used by the pool's algorithm to determine what portion of total rewards out of each block will be given to the user. Another entertaining aspect is that if a user collects a series of NFT cards covering all of the seven levels, the user can enjoy as high as 44% additional bonus when all the cards are stacked in the dividend pool. This design uniquely benefits NFT holders, as by staking their assets they can enjoy passive income along the time.",

            "description": "## What Is Biswap?\n\nBiswap is a decentralized exchange ([DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex)) enabling users to swap [BEP-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/bep-20) tokens on BNB Chain. It uses an automated market maker ([AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm)), allowing users to trade against a [liquidity pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool) with a constant product formula. Furthermore, users can engage in [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/yield-farming) and transaction fee mining. For example, miners receive up to 90% of transaction fees on [token swaps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) and can earn additional fees in the exchange’s native token. \n\nAnother key product is the [NFT](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) marketplace, where users can buy NFTs with different cryptocurrencies like [BNB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bnb/), [USDT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/), [BUSD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-usd/) and [WBNB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wbnb/). They can also buy the exchange’s own NFTs from its NFT Earn program, which is comprised of an NFT launchpad, a staking pool, and tools to boost and upgrade NFTs. This is complemented by the lottery, where prizes in the native token are up for grabs.\n\nFinally, the [IDO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-dex-offering) launchpad provides new projects with a way to raise funding through the exchange by tapping into its more than 300,000 users. Its global incentive program has more than $10 million ready for collaboration with other projects. The funds are allocated as grants for security audits and project development and form part of the exchange’s growth strategy.        \n\n\n## Who Are the Biswap Founders?\n\nBiswap does not provide any information on its founders but lists a team of pseudonymous contributors. The CEO is called “EK” and is a veteran in the crypto industry, according to the official documents. Furthermore, no information on possible investors is provided. \n\n\n## When Did Biswap Launch?\n\nThe exchange launched in July 2021. It quickly established itself as one of the major decentralized exchanges in the BNB ecosystem.\n\n\n## Where Is Biswap Located?\n\nAt the time of writing, there is no information available about where the exchange is located. \n\n \n\n\n## Biswap Restricted Countries\n\nThere is no information about possibly blocked or restricted countries on this exchange. \n\n\n## Biswap Supported Coins List \n\nBiswap supports almost all BEP-20 tokens available on BNB Chain.\n\n\n## How Much Are Biswap Fees?\n\nUnlike most other decentralized exchanges that charge 0.3% for token swaps, Biswap only charges 0.1%. Half of the fees are redistributed among liquidity providers and the other half is [burned](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/burned).\n\n\n## Is It Possible to Use Leverage or Margin Trade on Biswap?\n\nThere is no margin or leverage trading on this exchange.

            "description": "## What Is Osmosis?\n\nOsmosis is an advanced AMM protocol built using the [Cosmos SDK](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-deep-dive-into-the-cosmos-network-and-the-cosmos-ecosystem) that will allow developers to design, build, and deploy their own customized AMMs.\n\nHeterogeneity and sovereignty are two core tenets of the Cosmos ecosystem, and Osmosis takes these two values and extends them into core characteristics of this AMM protocol. Rather than aim for a one-size-fits-all homogeneous approach for AMMs and its liquidity pools, Osmosis is designed such that the most efficient solution is reachable through the process of experimentation and rapid iteration by leveraging the wisdom of the crowd. It achieves this by offering deep customizability to AMM designers, and a governance mechanism by which each AMM pool’s stakeholders (i.e. liquidity providers) can govern and direct their pools.\n\nAs a decentralized [P2P](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-peer-to-peer-p2p) protocol, the platform is used for trading tokens and creating [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity). The project conducted an ICO in October 2021. The token sale led by Paradigm Ventures helped the company to raise $21 million.\n\nOsmosis takes two of the core tenets of the Cosmos ecosystem (heterogeneity and sovereignty) and extends them into the core features of its AMM protocol. As such, the protocol utilizes self-governing liquidity pools that allow users to vote on pool parameters and protocols, and provide liquidity, and stake.\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Osmosis?\n\nThe DEX was launched by Osmosis Labs, founded by Josh Lee and Sunny Aggarwal. A graduate of Anderson University, Lee was one of the founding employees of Block in Press, a leading Korean blockchain media outlet. Between 2018 and 2019, he worked as the project manager at Lunamint where he curated the first native crypto wallet within the Telegram messenger. He has also functioned as a development analyst at Tendermint.\n\nAs for Aggarwal, he previously worked as a research scientist at Tendermint and is a core developer of the Cosmos SDK and Gaia blockchain. He is also the co-founder of Sikka, a company that works on DeFi protocols and networks.\n\n### When Was Osmosis Launched?\n\nOsmosis launched in June 2021.\n\n### Where Is Osmosis Located?\n\nThe company has its headquarters in Singapore.\n\n### Osmosis Restricted Countries\n\nAt the time of writing, it is unable to confirm if users in some regions are restricted from using the platform. \n\n### What Coins Are Supported on Osmosis?\n\nThe DEX platform currently supports swaps between 56 tokens in the Cosmos ecosystem.\n\n### How Much Are Osmosis Fees?\n\nAlthough swap fees range from 0.1% for direct route swaps to 0.5% for multi-hop Osmo route, most swaps are charged at 0.2% per pool, with a few variations.\n\n### Is it Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trading on Osmosis?\n\nThe DEX does not support margin trading.",

            "description": "## What Is SpookySwap?\n\n[SpookySwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/spookyswap/) is a [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) (DEX) on the [Fantom](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/fantom/) blockchain. It operates with an [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) (AMM) to provide constant liquidity for traders and allow them to trade against a [liquidity pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool). It also serves as a bridge between Fantom and other [layer-one blockchains](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-1-blockchain).\n\n[Token swaps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) allow customers to trade one token for another with liquidity in the pools. The exchange offers fees below the industry standard. Users can also add liquidity and earn from the swapping fees on the token pairs where they provided liquidity. With more than 18 token pairs, SpookySwap offers the most diverse [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/yield-farming) opportunities on the Fantom blockchain. \n\nFurthermore, there are single stake pools, where only one token type is needed to stake. In that case, users do not need an LP token and can earn from [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) only the platform’s native [BOO](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/spookyswap/) token. This allows them to get more assets and increase their share of fee-earning tokens.\n\nThere is also an [NFT](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) collection called Magicats, displaying the two mascot cat characters Grim and Ace. \n\nFinally, the exchange offers a [bridge](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/bridges) to other blockchains like [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), [BNB Chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/), [Polygon](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polygon/), and [Avalanche](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/). Users require a wallet and gas tokens of the chain they are bridging from. The transactions can take between 10 minutes and 24 hours, depending on the traffic.\n\n\n## Who Are the SpookySwap Founders?\n\nThe SpookySwap founders are anonymous and work in a decentralized manner.\n\n## When Did SpookySwap Launch?\n\nSpookySwap launched in April 2021 and has since earned endorsement and support from the Fantom Foundation and passed more than 50 proposals with its governance token. \n\n## Where Is SpookySwap Located?\n\nSpookySwap does not have one location but works in a decentralized manner.\n\n## SpookySwap Restricted Countries\n\nAt the time of writing, there is no information about restricted countries on this exchange. \n\n## SpookySwap Supported Coins List \n\nThe exchange supports token swaps for all Fantom-based tokens. \n\n## How Much Are SpookySwap Fees?\n\nAt the time of writing, token swaps incur a 0.2% trading fee, with 0.22% for limit orders. 0.17% of that is returned to the liquidity pools as a fee reward and 0.05% is allocated towards stakers. Unlike other DEXes, no money returns to the treasury. \n\n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trade on SpookySwap?\n\nSpookySwap does not offer [leverage](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/leverage) or [margin trading](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/margin-trading).",

            "description": "## What Is Trader Joe?\n\nTrader Joe is a [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi) platform offering several functions like [token swaps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) via an automated market maker ([AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm)), [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/yield-farming), [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) of the native [utility token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/utility-token), borrowing and lending on the integrated [money market](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/money-market) and an [NFT](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) marketplace. The platform is built on [Avalanche](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/), an [EVM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm)-compatible [layer-one blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-1-blockchain). It attracted a lot of growth in 2021 and quickly became an important [DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) in the Avalanche ecosystem.\n\nThe exchange stands out with its convenient user interface and cheap and fast transaction execution. Furthermore, users can earn by providing liquidity and staking the native token in one of the yield farms. The token can also be used for [governance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance). Its lending protocol, called Banker Joe, is a money market protocol, allowing users to borrow and lend funds without giving up their custody of them. \n\nAs part of the yield farming branch of the project, users can earn extra rewards through trading fees and tokens. They can also improve the capital efficiency of their assets and leverage capital that would otherwise be sitting idly in their wallet. Finally. there is also Rocket Joe, a platform that bootstraps protocol-owned liquidity for other projects. \n\n\n## Who Are the Trader Joe Founders?\n\nThe exchange was founded by two pseudonymous developers, called Cryptofish and 0xMurloc. The former is a full-stack and [smart contract](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) developer and an early contributor to several Avalanche projects. The latter is a full-stack developer with startup experience and a former Senior Product Lead at Grab. Over a dozen other contributors work on marketing and community. \n\n\n## When Did Trader Joe Launch?\n\nThe exchange launched in June 2021 and quickly had a lot of traction, drawing in as much as $4 billion in [total value locked](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/total-value-locked-tvl) at its peak.  \n\n\n## Where Is Trader Joe Located?\n\nThere is no information on Crunchbase about the exchange’s headquarters.\n\n \n\n\n## Trader Joe Restricted Countries\n\nTrader Joe does not provide any information about restricted countries. \n\n\n## Trader Joe Supported Coins List \n\nThe exchange offers a multitude of [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) tokens from the Avalanche ecosystem and wrapped tokens, like [wrapped Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-wrapped-bitcoin) and [wrapped Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-wrapped-ethereum-weth).  \n\n\n## How Much Are Trader Joe Fees?\n\nThere is a 0.3% fee for token swaps. 0.25% goes to liquidity providers and 0.05% to stakers.\n\n\n## Is It Possible to Use Leverage or Margin Trade on Trader Joe?\n\nThere is no margin or [leverage trading](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-leverage-in-crypto-trading-and-how-to-use-it) yet, but the exchange has plans in its [roadmap](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/roadmap) to introduce it in the future.",

            "description": "## What Is SushiSwap (Arbitrum)?\n\n[SushiSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sushiswap/) is a decentralized exchange ([DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex)) with an [AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) (automated market maker). It utilizes [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) to enable frictionless trading of different token pairs. Users can create their own token pairs and [provide liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens) to them. Initially a [fork](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/fork-software) of UniSwap, another famous DEX, the exchange was one of the earliest to adopt the model of the automated market maker. It sparked a boom and later grew into one of the biggest exchanges in all of [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi). It is currently available on almost all [EVM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm)-compatible [layer-one blockchains](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-1-blockchain) and multiple [layer-two](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-2) solutions for [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), [Arbitrum](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-arbitrum-the-ultimate-guide-to-the-arbitrum-ecosystem) being one of them. \n\nSushiSwap targets DeFi traders and institutions looking for [permissionless](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/permissionless) and [non-custodial](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-custodial) trading. It has a more egalitarian [governance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance) approach than other exchanges. Its native token can be used for voting on governance proposals.        \n\nOne of the core products is the Bento Box, a token vault that generates yield for the capital deposited into it. Another important product is Kashi, a lending and [margin trading](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/margin-trading) platform where anyone can create customized and gas-efficient markets for tokens. With MasterChef V2, the liquidity provision program, the exchange boasts over $1 billion in [TVL](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/total-value-locked-tvl) at the time of writing. Finally, Miso provides projects with access to trading on the platform either through fixed price or dutch auction options. \n\n\n## Who Are the SushiSwap Founders?\n\nChef Nomi, the [pseudonymous](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/pseudonymous) founder of SushiSwap, left the project not long after founding it. He passed management on to another pseudonymous developer, 0xMaki. Later, ownership switched again: that time to Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of FTX, a [centralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/centralized-exchange-cex). \n\n\n## When Did SushiSwap Launch?\n\nSushiSwap launched in August 2020. \n\n\n## Where Is SushiSwap Located?\n\nAs the exchange is mostly being worked on and developed by anonymous individuals, there is no centralized headquarter. \n\n \n\n\n## SushiSwap Restricted Countries\n\nThere is no information about possibly blocked or restricted countries on this exchange. \n\n\n## SushiSwap Supported Coins List \n\nWith its presence on almost all of the important [layer-one blockchains](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-1-blockchain) and [layer-two](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-2) solutions, SushiSwap supports almost all [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) tokens on the market.\n\n\n## How Much Are SushiSwap Fees?\n\nThe exchange charges the industry standard of 0.3% for token swaps.\n\n\n## Is It Possible to Use Leverage or Margin Trade on SushiSwap?\n\nSushiswap offers Kashi, a lending and margin trading platform that uses a unique [isolated market](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/isolated-margin) framework.",

            "description": "## What Is Uniswap (V3) (Arbitrum)?\n\n[Uniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniswap/) is a [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) (DEX) that pioneered the [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) (AMM) model. The introduction of the AMM allowed users to trade against a [liquidity pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool) offering a constant source of liquidity with its product formula. The V3 version of the exchange presents services to [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) [layer-two](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-2) solutions. \n\nThe AMM model premiered in the V1 version of the exchange, with the V2 version allowing trading between different [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token pairs instead of [swaps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) between [ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) and ERC-20 tokens. The consequence was reduced [slippage](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/slippage), benefiting the evolution of the exchange. Furthermore, it introduced protocol fees to continue development. In the V2 version, [wrapped Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-wrapped-ethereum-weth) instead of native Ether was available for the first time as liquidity for token pairs.\n\nImprovements in the V3 version include unique price curves for [liquidity providers](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens), allowing them to centralize their capital at desired prices to improve capital efficiency. Another feature implies the automatic capital removal if prices change significantly and exceed the LP’s price range. The V3 is the first version available on [Arbitrum](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-arbitrum-the-ultimate-guide-to-the-arbitrum-ecosystem), a scaling solution for Ethereum that opens up a more affordable trading experience thanks to its significantly lower trading fees.  \n\n\n## Who Is the Founder of Uniswap (V3) (Arbitrum)?\n\nHayden Adams, a former mechanical engineer at Siemens and Stony Brook University graduate, founded the decentralized exchange in November 2018. Uniswap Labs, the development company behind the DEX, was financed by [crypto VC funds](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-the-top-crypto-venture-capital-firms) like Paradigm in a Series A, raising $11 million in the round led by ​​Andreessen Horowitz.\n\n\n## When Did Uniswap (V3) (Arbitrum) Launch?\n\nV1 launched in November 2018. The improved V2 version hit the market in August 2020. The V3 version launched in May 2021 on Ethereum and on August 31, 2022, on Arbitrum. \n\n\n## Where Is Uniswap (V3) (Arbitrum) Located?\n\nThe headquarters of Uniswap Labs are in New York City. \n\n\n## Uniswap (V3) (Arbitrum) Restricted Countries\n\nUniswap has officially restricted the following countries from using its services: Belarus, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Côte d'Ivoire, Liberia, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Iraq, and Iran.\n\n\n## Uniswap (V3) (Arbitrum) Supported Coins List \n\nSince this is a [permissionless](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/permissionless) decentralized exchange, any user is free to list tokens and provide liquidity to facilitate trading. The most liquid tokens, at the time of writing, include [stablecoins](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/stablecoin) and wrapped tokens like [USDC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/), [Wrapped BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wrapped-bitcoin/), [wETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/weth/), and [DAI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/). \n\n\n## How Much Are Uniswap (V3) (Arbitrum) Fees?\n\nThe V3 version has a flexible fee mechanism. Stablecoin trading pairs are the cheapest, with a  0.05% fee. Standard non-correlated pools like ETH carry a fee of 0.30%, with other pairs priced at a fee of 1%. There is no more protocol fee, although it can be turned on through [governance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance). \n\n\n## Is It Possible to Use Leverage or Margin Trade on Uniswap (V3) (Arbitrum)?\n\nUniswap V3 does not offer [leverage](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/leverage) or [margin trading](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/margin-trading).",

With its groundbreaking one-of-a-kind market-making model, Oyster AMM, SynFutures combines the best of the order book and AMM to maximize capital efficiency and appeal to a broad range of traders and investors. \n\nDeployed on multiple blockchains, SynFutures was named one of the largest derivative exchanges on Polygon and is among the top three most actively used decentralized derivative exchanges in Web3. Backers include Tier 1 Web3 institutional investors Pantera Capital, Polychain Capital, Susquehanna International Group (SIG), Dragonfly Capital, Standard Crypto, and Framework Ventures. Team members have extensive experience at global financial institutions, fintech companies, and blockchain technology companies, such as Alipay, Bitmain, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Matrixport, and Nomura Securities. \n\nSynFutures recently completed its Series B funding round, securing an additional $22 million and bringing heir total funding raised to $38 million.\n\nWhat is SynFutures V3?\nV3 is SynFutures’ most significant protocol update. Oyster AMM. Oyster AMM builds upon the foundational architecture established in previous versions of SynFutures while welcoming a variety of features catered to the needs of everyday traders and professional participants. Oyster AMM is designed to blend the simplicity of automated market-making harmoniously with the efficiency of order book models, creating a seamless experience for newcomers and seasoned professionals.\n\nKey Features of Oyster AMM:\n\nSingle-Token Concentrated Liquidity for Derivatives: Oyster AMM facilitates liquidity concentration within specific price ranges and incorporates leverage to boost capital efficiency. Unlike spot market-focused liquidity models, it introduces a margin management and liquidation framework tailored for derivatives, using a single token to streamline the trading ecosystem.\n\nA Fully Onchain Order Book: While AMMs democratize market access, they demand significant liquidity for equivalent price impact compared to order book models. To address this, SynFutures V3 introduces an onchain order book model and its CL AMM, ensuring transparency, trustlessness, and anti-censorship, eliminating dependence on centralized administrators.\n\nA Single Model for Unified Liquidity: Oyster AMM integrates concentrated liquidity and order book into a single model, offering unified liquidity tailored to active traders and passive liquidity providers. This cohesive approach ensures efficient atomic transactions and avoids non-synchronization issues in dual-process execution systems.\n\nStabilization Mechanism for User Protection: The Oyster AMM introduces advanced financial risk management mechanisms to enhance user protection and price stability. These mechanisms include a dynamic penalty fee system discouraging price manipulation and balancing the LP's risk-reward profile.\n\nFind out more about SynFutures at https://www.synfutures.com/",

It is similar to Uniswap, with a few changes:\n- Multiple pools in a single contract. Traders can trade across pools atomically in a single transaction\n- Customizable LP fees per pool. LPs can charge higher fees for illiquid or highly volatile tokens. Referral fees for swaps, currently set at 1 bps.

We are all about gamification, so we want to maximize the feedback loop of earning, staking, and earning again; all these and more can be achieved by KCC’s superior speed and lower transaction fees. Honestly, while KCC might not have Ethereum’s currently level of adoption, in the foreseeable future KCC is growing to bridge the gap in many ways.",

With significantly better performance, the scope of AMMs can be rapidly expanded, giving birth to new market opportunities.",

            "description": "## What Is Uniswap (V3) Polygon?\n\nUniswap is a [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) (DEX) that introduced the [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) (AMM) model for the first time in the market. With this innovation, traders tap into a constant pool of liquidity and trade against an algorithm using a constant product formula. With its V3 version, the exchange branched out to blockchains other than [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) for the first time. \n\nAfter the introduction of the AMM model in V1, the V2 version allowed trading between different [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token pairs instead of [swaps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) between [ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) and ERC-20 tokens. This reduced [slippage](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/slippage) and introduced protocol fees to continue the exchange’s development. The V2 version also introduced [wrapped Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-wrapped-ethereum-weth) instead of native Ether as liquidity for token pairs.\n\nIn the V3 version, [liquidity providers ](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens)can build unique price curves and centralize their capital at desired prices to improve capital efficiency. It also activated automatic removal of capital if prices change significantly and exceed the LP’s price range. With the introduction of V3, Uniswap also launched on Polygon for the first time. Thanks to its lower gas fees, users can now access a much more affordable trading experience   \n\n\n## Who Is the Founder of Uniswap (V3) Polygon?\n\nThe exchange was founded by Hayden Adams, a former mechanical engineer at Siemens and Stony Brook University graduate in November 2018. Uniswap Labs, the development company behind the exchange, raised a seed round from Paradigm and $11 million in a Series A round led by ​​Andreessen Horowitz.\n\n\n## When Did Uniswap (V3) Polygon Launch?\n\nAfter the launch of the V1 version in November 2018 and the subsequent improvement with the V2 version in August 2020, the V3 version was launched in May 2021. However, the V3 version came out on Polygon only in November 2021.\n\n\n## Where Is Uniswap (V3) Polygon Located?\n\nThe headquarters of Uniswap Labs are in New York City. \n\n\n## Uniswap (V3) Polygon Restricted Countries\n\nUniswap has officially restricted the following countries from using its services: Belarus, Cuba, North Korea, Syria, Côte d'Ivoire, Liberia, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Iraq and Iran.\n\n\n## Uniswap (V3) Polygon Supported Coins List \n\nAs a [permissionless](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/permissionless) decentralized exchange, tokens can be freely listed by anyone providing liquidity to trade them.

            "description": "## What Is Tinyman Platform (TINY)?\r\n\r\nTinyman is a decentralized trading protocol, utilizing the fast and secure framework of the Algorand blockchain to create an open and safe marketplace for traders, liquidity providers, and developers. Tinyman, built by a team with experienced fintech backgrounds, is on a mission to realize the full potential of DeFi, or financial tools that run on blockchain and are inclusive, accessible, and profitable for users far and wide. With the community-focused, cheap, fast, and fully permissionless Tinyman protocol, users are able to trade any Algorand Standard Asset (or Algo) through liquidity pools using an Automated Market Maker (AMM) algorithm.\r\n\r\nAn example of an automated market maker (AMM), Tinyman launched in October 2021, and it has a growing audience and liquidity. Within Tinyman Platform, traders have access to liquidity provision and swapping on Algorand blockchain along with general and personal analytics tools for overseeing their accounts. Development at Tinyman continues to introduce additional features in the near future.\r\n\r\n## What makes Tinyman unique?\r\n\r\nTinyman has been able to overcome scalability and usability challenges -big hurdles for some emerging DeFi ecosystems- by leveraging the Algorand blockchain’s decentralized layer-1 solution, which utilizes a unique Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism. The PPoS protocol enables platforms like Tinyman to scale to millions of users while sustaining a high transaction rate without incurring significant cost to participants, and while remaining energy efficient and friendly to the planet. \r\n\r\n\r\nTinyman aims to keep Asset trading automated and completely open to everyone, especially including those that possess lesser funds encouraging a fair economy that is built upon the idea granting impartial and inclusive access.\r\n\r\nTinyman's smart contracts benefit from Algorand's distinctive cryptographic sortition mechanism to prevent front running attacks on the platform transactions. ( Front running is a common phenomena caused by bad actors in AMM platforms which results in normal traders getting worse exchange rates than anticipated, hence making the trades to be less profitable. )\r\n\r\n\r\n## Is there a TINY token?\r\n\r\nTINY native governance token will be issued according to the timeline on the Tinyman’s roadmap. It will be created on the Algorand chain as ASA (Algorand Standart Asset). The functionalities will be revealed once it is issued:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Who Are the Founders of TINYMAN Protocol?\r\n\r\nTinyman Protocol is founded by Tinyman itself and its friends who are a team of product builders with a strong background in UX and UI designs and apps for fintechs, neobanks, trading platforms, and other companies for over ten years. \r\n\r\nWhen Tinyman team worked with Algorand on developing wallet applications, they experienced the blockchain’s great benefits. Founders wished to empower decentralized stable economies where everyone can become a part. Therefore, Tinyman was founded by the ones that share these ideas and dream of relinquishing all control to the community for the development and decision making of alternative ecosystems in its maturity.",

They also believe they have spotted the disadvantages of most decentralized exchanges and decided to launch DEFYSWAP, a model where the issues identified are being taken care of while maintaining all of the usual features you've come to expect from any DEX (Automated Market Making AMM, Swapping/Trading, Liquidity Pools, Yield Farming & Pools).\r\n\r\nThese are some of the features that have been integrated to insure a complex and fair user experience with a focus on future viability and user utility:\r\n\r\n*Fixed Supply (10,000,000 tokens ) *Limit Orders *Impermanent Loss Protection (ILP Details) *Futuristic UI -- Chart, trading tools, order book, recent trades, open/executed/cancelled tab *NFT Layer *DefyCredit - A new concept lending platform *Taxed token Haven: according to them, their code is designed to differentiate between a trade transaction and a creation/disassembling of LP. Therefore, no tax applies on LP related transactions while regular taxes work on trades, so therefore liquidity providers won't lose money when entering and exiting a farm of a taxed token on Defyswap.\r\n\r\nThrough constant assessment and re-assessment they feel they have designed an entire user experience that will allow you to take your crypto trading skillset to the next level and ensure that you can always be making the most well informed decisions as the tools are readily at hand.\r\n\r\nDefy team being ground level and developing everything custom all the way up, oriented towards receiving community feedback to allow for quick additions / customization of DefySwap features to further advance the capabilities of the DEX as a whole.\r\n\r\nTokenomics\r\n\r\nThe tokenomics of DefySwap provide a NO TAX experience across the board when it comes down to platform fees, farm entry and exit etc. Striving to obtain a fair and balanced DEX.\r\n\r\nAccording to them, they have also devised a method in which the $DFY token will mint out over the course of a 2 year time frame and through a 4.99% (to be able to use 5% slippage) tax in which a vast majority of it goes to a burn vault that will accumulate a VERY large amount of $DFY over the course of the 2 year minting process and allow for an automated contractual reset of the minting process using the burn vault on the last token mint transaction. Thus the max supply never exceeding 10 Million tokens.",

            "description": "## What Is Spartan Protocol (SPARTA)?\r\n\r\nSpartan Protocol is a Decentralised Finance (Defi) project built on top of Binance Smart Chain (BSC). With a focus on incentivised liquidity pools and SyntheticYield Assets, Spartan Protocol allows users to earn revenue by providing liquidity to pools and creating derivative tokens through Synthetic Assets.\r\n\r\nNotable similar projects are Uniswap on the Ethereum (ETH) network & and ThorChain. Bringing these features to the BSC network allows users to take advantage of BSC's low gas fees and fast settlements.\r\n\r\n### Who Are the Founders of Spartan Protocol?\r\nSpartan Protocol was founded by the communities of former Binance Chain projects with a strong vision of decentralisation. At its inception, all SPARTA tokens were acquired by a Proof-of-Burn process of selected BEP20 tokens, thus there isn't any founder/team tokens or treasury. With the use of DAO governance, every token holder has a voice with Spartan Protocol built & run by the community, for the community.\r\n\r\n### What Makes Spartan Protocol Unique?\r\nAt its core, Spartan Protocol provides incentivized liquidity pools that are facilitated by an automated market maker (AMM) algorithm that has liquidity-sensitive fees. The AMM algorithm provides transparency while reducing slippage and latency caused by human intervention/manipulation. With liquidity-sensitive fees, it is ensured that the system will be able to detect correct token purchasing at all times thus resulting in scalable and risk-tolerant growth. Coupled with various other features like Synths, the use cases for the underlying pools increase thus resulting in higher revenue generation with higher APYs.\r\n\r\nSynthetic assets are a fairly unique part of Spartan Protocol, through the generation of synthetic assets, users can create derivative tokens that allow users to go long or short on various markets without having the need to own the particular asset. Synthetic assets are generated through the use of price anchors offered by the liquidity pools on Spartan Protocol and collateralized by liquidity pool shares. The liquidity pool shares are on-market, value-stabilized and can be instantly liquidated. Liquidity-sensitive fees ensure that positions taken up will scale with the depth of the available liquidity, preventing the deleveraging spirals that are common in many similar systems.\r\n\r\nThe Spartan DAO is a mechanism that is used to govern the entire ecosystem and distribute protocol incentives.",

            "description": "On November 26, 2021, MuesliSwap successfully launched a decentralized exchange on Cardano mainnet, making it the first among many competitors to leap into this new era of DeFi on Cardano.\r\n\r\nWith MuesliSwap, a novel approach for modelling and implementing a DEX on Cardano is proposed by revisiting the traditional order book model. The exchange protocol draws from game-theoretic concepts and distinguishes itself from alternatives through simplicity, modularity, self-regulation, and full decentralization, thus paving the way for MuesliSwap to become the first operational DEX on Cardano. For technical details, we refer to the scientific whitepaper outlining the results of MuesliSwap's rigorous research.\r\n\r\nThe approach to token trading by the MuesliSwap Team distinguishes itself from the popular approaches to trading, taking into account the Cardano transaction model. The EUTxO model of the Cardano blockchain makes it possible to use the order book model as a decentralized exchange, in contrast to the AMM model used on other blockchains. MuesliSwap will support limit orders bringing full control to your investments. What's more, the innovative protocol offers fast transaction settlements paired with low fees and protects against frontrunning.\r\n\r\nOverall, MuesliSwap aims to enrich the Cardano Defi ecosystem with a range of new trading features, not only limiting itself to Token Trading but also an NFT Marketplace and a decentralized Token Launchpad.\r\n\r\nThe token MILK is the utility token that powers the Cardano MuesliSwap ecosystem. It has many useful benefits, available for pre-sale until a few days after launch.",

An evolution from the traditional exchange, the Bullish Order Book pairs the high-performance of a traditional Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) with Automated Market Making (AMM) — a protocol that uses a mathematical algorithm to facilitate prices in a transparent, market-neutral, and deterministic manner. The Bullish Order Book is underpinned by customizable automated market making instructions (AMM instructions) for each trading pair and is intended to reward asset holders whilst providing liquidity to the asset pairs the exchange offers for trading. AMM instructions offers clients the ability to trade and earn income at scale across highly variable market conditions.\n\nBullish currently offers pairs listed here: https://bullish.com/trade/ and intends to broaden its digital asset offerings in the future, subject to applicable regulatory requirements, based on customer demand.\n\nTotal trade volume can be viewed on the bullish.com homepage. Bullish is available in 40+ jurisdictions globally.\n\nBullish is seeking to go public on the New York Stock Exchange through a merger with special purpose acquisition company Far Peak Acquisition Corp (NYSE: FPAC), a special purpose acquisition company, The Bullish leadership team comprises financial services, blockchain and technology experts and, following a business combination with FPAC, Bullish will be led by Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Thomas W. Farley, FPAC’s Chairman and CEO and the former President of the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nA majority owned subsidiary of blockchain software company Block.one, Bullish has operating subsidiaries in Gibraltar, the Cayman Islands, the United States, Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\nBullish offers an institutional-caliber regulatory compliance framework, licensed and regulated by the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission’s Distributed Ledger Technology Regulatory Framework (DLT license: FSC1038FSA).

Bullish is also registered as a Money Service Business with the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”).\n\nBullish offers a layered custody solution that combines offline cold storage utilizing complex, multi-sig, white-list only transfer processes with self-managed hot wallets. Bullish reduces risk concentration utilizing multiple segregated wallets; and is designed so that sensitive and critical custody components and asset-based operations are cryptographically verified, signed and attested.\n\nBullish leverages a private blockchain in order to integrate the strategic advantages of blockchain’s inherent capabilities into the platform design, and achieve a new degree of security, transparency, and resiliency. Combined with WebAuthn standards, which eliminate many security vulnerabilities inherent with passwords by using public key cryptography, users will experience a password-free authentication environment, creating a more secure onboarding process and ongoing account access.\n\nRelated Pages: Bullish.com Exchange.bullish.com Investor.bullish.com",

            "description": "What is YuzuSwap?\r\nYuzuSwap is a decentralized exchange on the Oasis Emerald paratime that includes incentives like liquidity & and trade mining. YuzuSwap follows a non-custodial, peer-to-peer, automated-market-maker model, and aims to provide a safe, swift, low-cost tool to discover and swap tokens within the Oasis ecosystem. The YuzuSwap platform itself is fully open to developers and members of the Yuzu DAO.\r\nCore Features\r\n- Fair Launch There was no pre-mine. All tokens are mined block by block from the genesis . This includes team/foundation/investors tokens! Additionally, the amount of tokens mined in each block will halve every year.\r\n- Trade Once, Mine Forever\r\nYuzuSwap's trade mining mechanism is designed based on a TPST (trading pool share token). Once users trade in incentivized trading pairs, they will get a balance in TPST, similar to LPT (liquidity provider token) as their evidence of trading. They will receive the trade mining token in each block according to the share of TPST. If the user does not claim the trade mining rewards, TPST balance will always be there and mine in each block until user chooses to claim the trade mining rewards, after which the TPST balance will reset to zero.\r\n- Buyback\r\nOf the 0.3% transaction fee, 80% will go to the buyback smart contract. This contract will trigger buying YUZU token action if the price of it drops below the 72 hour average. So the more transaction fee accumulated, the healthier YUZU token price will be.\r\n- DAO Vault\r\nThe other 20% of the transaction fees will go to the DAO vault. The usage of the DAO vault will be voted by YUZU token holders. Possible uses include to incentivize developers to develop tools for YuzuSwap, co-invest in other projects on Oasis, and purchase insurance for YuzuSwap, and so forth.\r\n- Infinitely Extensible\r\nYuzuSwap is able to be integrated into any projects on Oasis. For instance: users could collateralize their LPT (liquidity provider token) on the upcoming lending protocol on Oasis and regain their liquidity. Alternatively, they can also borrow LPT from the lending protocol to mine YUZU token without the concern of potential impermanent loss. The DAO vault may opt to purchasing insurance for pools on YuzuSwap, so even if unexpected incidents happen, those pools will be covered by insurance. Promising new projects on Oasis could apply for IDO/IFO on YuzuSwap, and it will be a great way to raise fund for projects from the community. Users with YUZU tokens will vote for which project may go live on the IDO/IFO launchpad, whether or not to allocate mining pool to the new token, and what percentage of the mining pool will be allocate to the new token, etc.",

It aims to solve the the largest problems in DeFi by aggregating the liquidity of the entire crypto market into one decentralized platform – pulling from every major centralized exchange, decentralized exchange, and swapping pool. Orion provides access to the best price in the market without the need to ever give up their assets. \r\n\r\nOrion is building over a dozen solutions for blockchains, exchanges, and crypto projects, resulting in over eighteen revenue streams on the protocol. The Orion ecosystem has been built with ORN holders in mind: every transaction across the multiple solutions on the protocol adds to Daily Protocol Volume, bringing lucrative rewards to its stakers.\r\n\r\nOrion seeks to solve the fragmentation of crypto markets, NFTs marketplaces, and assets from traditional finance by eventually aggregating them into one place: Orion Terminal.",

            "description": "##What is Minswap (MIN)?\n\nMinswap is a Decentralized Exchange ([DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex)) on the Cardano (ADA) blockchain. For each swap, a fee is taken, which mainly goes to the Liquidity Providers (LPs). LPs on Minswap can stake their LP Tokens to earn MIN Tokens in [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/yield-farming). \n\nMinswap launched in March 2022 and quickly became the DEX with the highest Trading Volume and Total Value Locked ([TVL](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/total-value-locked-tvl)) on Cardano. Minswap is a community-centric DEX with no private or VC investment. MIN tokens are given to protocol participants and LPs, who can participate in [governance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance) and vote on protocol changes. MIN Token holders are also eligible for swap fee discounts when trading.\n\nMinswap takes advantage of the liquid staking of ADA to stake the ADA deposited in the DEX [Smart Contract](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract), enabling LPs keep earning ADA staking rewards. Minswap offers projects the option to offer their own token rewards in yield farming. As such, in some cases LPs earn 4x rewards (MIN Tokens + ADA staking reward + Project Token + Trading Fees). Lastly, the Minswap Launchbowl, encompasses the initiatives other projects can use to bootstrap their Liquidity on Minswap.\n\n##Who Are the Minswap Founders?\n\nThe Minswap DEX is mainly developed by the Minswap Labs entity, a group of DeFi natives and developers mainly based in Vietnam.\n\n##How much are swap fees on Minswap?\n\nThere is a 0.3% fee for token swaps. 0.25% goes to liquidity providers and 0.05% towards a Fee Switch mechanism. There is a fixed 2 ADA batcher fee that can be reduced depending on how many MIN Tokens the user has in their wallet.\n",

            "description": "## What Is FstSwap?\n\nFstSwap is a [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) (DEX) for [BEP-20 token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/bep-20) [swaps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) on the [BNB Chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bnb/). It uses an [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) (AMM) model to enable fast, cheap and frictionless trading. Traders get matched by a [liquidity pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool) that [liquidity providers](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens) can deposit capital into. They receive [LP tokens](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-liquidity-pool-lp-tokens) for doing so and get a share of the trading fees based on their LP tokens. \n\nThe exchange also has a [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/yield-farming) program, which allows staking LP tokens to earn the native token. Different farms have different [APRs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/annual-percentage-rate-apr), but traders have to pay attention to potential [impermanent loss](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/impermanent-loss). Liquidity pools on the exchange are called farm pools, elephant pools and combustion pools. Farm pools provide a chance to stake LP tokens of FstSwap and other BEP-20 tokens and receive rewards. Elephant pools also pay staking rewards, while combustion pools enable token [burns](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/burned).  \n\nThe exchange also provides a detailed roadmap with plans to offer fundraising for future token launches, an [NFT](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) ecosystem, personalized user profiles and lending of LP tokens. \n\n\n## Who Are the FstSwap Founders?\n\nFstSwap does not disclose any information about its founders. From two community AMAs, it can be assumed that the team is based in Asia. The exchange passed a security audit by Certik. In the future, it plans to introduce [DAO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao) [governance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance), where token holders can vote according to their share of native tokens staked.  \n\n\n## When Did FstSwap Launch?\n\nFstSwap launched in April 2022.\n\n\n## Where Is FstSwap Located?\n\nThe exchange does not provide any information about its location. According to information from community AMAs, the team is likely located in Asia. \n\n \n\n\n## FstSwap Restricted Countries\n\nAt the time of writing, there is no information about restricted countries on this exchange.\n\n\n## FstSwap Supported Coins List \n\nThe exchange supports all BEP-20 tokens. Due to its decentralized nature, users can list new tokens in a permissionless manner, as long as they provide enough liquidity to facilitate trading. \n\n\n## How Much Are FstSwap Fees?\n\nAt the time of writing, token swaps incur a 0.30% trading fee. The entire transaction fee is distributed back to the AMM liquidity provider. \n\n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trade on FstSwap?\n\nFstSwap does not support leverage or margin trading.

            "description": "## What KyberSwap Elastic (Polygon)?\n\nKyberSwap Elastic (Polygon) is an upgrade to the existing protocol known as KyberDMM (now KyberSwap Classic). The new protocol inherits all the KyberSwap Classic strengths, while introducing [concentrated liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/concentrated-liquidity).\n\nAs a tick-based automated [market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-automated-market-makers) (AMM), the protocol allows liquidity providers (LPs) to supply liquidity to an Elastic pool using a custom price range of their choice. LPs can either set a narrow or a wide price range that accommodates riskier [tokens](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token) and markets. The protocol also features a Reinvestment Curve that compounds fees by automatically reinvesting the fee earnings of LPs back into the liquidity pool.\n\n### Who Are the Founders of KyberSwap Elastic (Polygon)?\n\nThe company was founded by Loi Luu and Victor Tran. Loi Luu got his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the National University of Singapore, where he worked to improve the base technical layers of the public blockchain infrastructure.

He obtained a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Engineering and Technology, Vietnam National University.\n\n### When Was KyberSwap Elastic (Polygon) Launched?\n\nThe company was founded in 2017 and launched on the Ethereum [mainnet](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/mainnet) in February 2018.\n\n### Where Is KyberSwap Elastic (Polygon) Located?\n\nThe firm is based in Singapore.\n\n### KyberSwap Elastic (Polygon) Restricted Countries\n\nAccording to the company’s terms and conditions, residents in the following countries are not allowed to use KyberSwap Elastic: Albania, Barbados, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cayman Islands, Haiti, Jamaica, Malta, Mauritius, Morocco, Myanmar, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Philippines, Senegal, South Sudan, Syria, Uganda, Yemen, Zimbabwe, Iran, and North Korea.\n\n### What Coins Are Supported on KyberSwap Elastic (Polygon)?\n\nThe exchange has 65 markets, with the most popular trading pairs being MATIC/STMATIC, USDC/STMATIC, and USDC/USDT.\n\n### How Much Are KyberSwap Elastic (Polygon) Fees?\n\nKyberSwap Elastic (Polygon) offers a 5-fee tier, which allows LPs to choose the fee tier they want. It ranges across 0.008%, 0.01%, 0.03%, 0.04%, and 1%.\n\n### Is it Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trading on KyberSwap Elastic (Polygon)?\n\nThe platform does not support margin trading.",

            "description": "## About QuickSwap\n\nQuickSwap is a [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) that runs on Polygon Network to offer cheaper and faster transactions. Its [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) integrates upgradeable [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) on [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) and renders [intermediaries](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/intermediary-middleman) obsolete. The exchange is based on open-source software and prioritizes decentralization, [censorship resistance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/censorship-resistance) and security. It benefits from ultra-low gas prices compared to Ethereum, as well as fast and simple trading execution.    \n\nAnyone can become a [liquidity provider](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens) by depositing two tokens into a [liquidity pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool). The exchange enables the trading of [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) tokens, which are traded according to the constant product formula. The mechanism removes the need for an [order book](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/order-book) and allows traders to tap into a constant pool of liquidity. \n\nLiquidity providers can passively invest their assets to accumulate trading fees or provide liquidity as a hedge for certain trading strategies. Traders use tools like [token swaps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) or can deploy arbitrage bots to compare prices across different exchanges. Finally, developers integrate the exchange with different liquidity aggregators or [wallets](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/hot-wallet).\n\n\n## Who Are the QuickSwap Founders?\n\nQuickSwap was founded by Roc Zacharias, who is also the CEO of Lunar Digital Assets, a blockchain marketing and consultancy firm that also acts as an advisor to the exchange. It is furthermore advised by the Matic Foundation, a governing body of the Polygon blockchain. \n\n\n## When Did QuickSwap Launch?\n\nQuickSwap launched in May 2021 with over 96% of the tokens distributed to the community. It is now considered the main decentralized exchange for Polygon, a [layer-two](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-2) solution for Ethereum. \n\n\n## Where Is QuickSwap Located?\n\nThe exchange doesn’t provide any information about its headquarters.\n\n \n\n\n## QuickSwap Restricted Countries\n\nAt the time of writing, there is no information about restricted countries on this exchange.\n\n\n## QuickSwap Supported Coins List \n\nQuickSwap supports all ERC-20 tokens deployed on Polygon, including wrapped tokens like [wrapped Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-wrapped-bitcoin). \n\n\n## How Much Are QuickSwap Fees?\n\nThe exchange charges a 0.3% fee for swapping tokens, which is distributed among liquidity providers on a pro-rata basis. \n\n\n## Is It Possible to Use Leverage or Margin Trade on QuickSwap?\n\nThere is no margin or [leverage trading](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-leverage-in-crypto-trading-and-how-to-use-it) option on this exchange.

The AMM utilizes [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) to create markets for trading pairs of a wide variety of tokens. [Liquidity providers](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens) supply VERSE DEX with capital, earning yield from the fees paid by people who trade. Verse DEX is derived from the battle tested Uniswap V2 contract, and has been audited by a third-party smart contract auditor. Verse DEX is available on Ethereum and SmartBCH blockchains, but is continuously expanding onto low-fee, high transaction speed blockchains.\n\nVerse DEX aims to bring everyone [permissionless](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/permissionless) and [non-custodial](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-custodial) trading access, with a special focus on people new to [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi).\n\n## Who is the Founder of Verse DEX?\n\nVerse DEX was created by Bitcoin.com, creator of the self-custodial Bitcoin.com Wallet. The Verse DEX, which will work seamlessly with the Bitcoin.com Wallet, acts as a gateway to DeFi for Bitcoin.com’s millions of users.\n\n## When Did Verse DEX Launch?\n\nVerse DEX launched in April 2022.\n\n## Where is Verse DEX Located?\n\nWhile Verse DEX was created by Bitcoin.com, Headquartered in Saint Kitts and Nevis, the exchange operates in a decentralized manner via smart contracts.\n\n## Verse DEX Restricted Countries\n\nThere is no information about possibly blocked or restricted countries on Verse DEX.\n\n## Verse DEX Supported Coins List\n\nSince Verse DEX is a decentralized exchange, it supports any token people wish to provide liquidity for on the chains that Verse DEX supports. Currently, Verse DEX supports Ethereum [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) and SmartBCH SEP-20 tokens. Supported coins will increase as Verse DEX expands to more blockchains.\n\n## How Much are Verse DEX Fees?\n\nVerse DEX charges 0.3% per token swap. 0.05% goes to the protocol and 0.25% goes to [liquidity providers](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens).\n\n## Is It Possible to Use Leverage or Margin Trade on Verse DEX?\n\nVerse DEX does not currently offer leverage or margin trading.",

            "description": "What Is BabyDogeSwap?\nBabyDogeSwap is a popular decentralized exchange (DEX) allowing BEP-20 token swaps on the BNB Chain. It is the biggest exchange of the BNB Chain ecosystem and one of the top community DEXs by the baby doge community. The exchange employs an automated market maker (AMM) model, allowing users to swap against a liquidity pool. You can become a liquidity provider and receive LP tokens, which entitle users to a share of the swap fees.\n\nLP token holders can also engage in yield farming to earn BabyDoge, the swap's utility token. The token can be staked in so-called ‘Farms’ or Pools with flexible or fixed-term staking. When the BabyDoge token is held in your wallet users receive lower swap fees.\n\nWho Are the BabyDogeSwap Founders?\nThe BabyDogeSwap founders are anonymous. The swap is open-source and has been audited by reputable security firm Certik. This is a community first project.\n\nWhen Did BabyDogeSwap Launch?\nBabyDogeSwap launched in October 2022\n\nWhere Is BabyDogeSwap Located?\nAs it is a decentralized exchange, the team works remotely. \n\nBabyDogeSwap Restricted Countries\nThere are no restricted countries or regions since the exchange is decentralized. However, the following countries and regions are geoblocked: Cuba, Iran, Zimbabwe, Iraq, Crimea, Syria, Sudan, Belarus and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nBabyDogeSwap Supported Coins List\nAll BEP-20 tokens can be traded, such as BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, BNB/USDT, and all other big layer-one blockchains.\n\nHow Much Are BabyDogeSwap Fees?\nAt the time of writing, token swaps incur a 0.30% trading fee, with 0.20% returned to the liquidity pools as a fee reward, 0.05% sent to the treasury and 0.05% sent towards a buyback and burn program. However some pairs such as BabyDoge/BNB and other requested pairs have a 0% Swap fee. In addition when holding the BabyDoge token users receive up to 70% OFF per swap giving as low as 0.09% swap fees. Perhaps the lowest swap fees in all of defi !",

            "description": "## What Is CroSwap (CROS)?\n\nCroSwap is an exclusive Automated Market Maker (AMM) based decentralized Exchange platform (DEX) designed to facilitate automated trading of decentralized finance tokens (DeFi) on multiple blockchain networks. CroSwap is designed to be the most user-friendly DeFi platform for users to be able to learn, swap, and earn high yields.\n\nOur exchange allows you to trade assets without using Centralized Exchanges. All transactions initiated on CroSwap are routed directly through your decentralized wallet. Your assets remain in your possession rather than relying on a Centralized Exchange to secure your assets. Our multi-chain DEX is primarily based on the Cronos Network. We strive to provide an optimal trading environment for our users. We currently have a 0.2% trading fee, which is one of the lowest trading fees on the Cronos Network.\n\nCROS is the primary utility token that is used for:\n\n* Incentivizing liquidity provisioning in our unique pool and yield farming.\n* Obtaining access to products/opportunities in our ecosystem.\n* Reducing fees on eligible products in our ecosystem.\n\nThe main function of CroSwap’s token CROS is to incentivize the liquidity provision to CroSwap’s Ecosystem. Users are able to stake and lock in specific Liquidity Pairs to help CroSwap maintain and grow overall liquidity backing in return for rewards (in the form of LP tokens). Rewards are scaled based on the amount of LP tokens a user has committed relative to the overall amount of LP tokens staked across the ecosystem for that specific farm.\n\n### Who Are the Founders of CroSwap?\n\nCroSwap is the flagship product of HLWGroup, a technology company focused on cryptocurrency development and management as well as video game development. \n\nOur core software development team has over 120 years of combined software engineering experience, capable of flexing for larger projects as needed. Our business development team has over 100 years of project management experience. We operate primarily in the U.S. with offshore resources around the world.\n\n### What makes CroSwap Unique?\n\nCroSwap is the first DEX built using the newly finalized [EIP-2535](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) Solidity Standard, commonly referred to as The Diamond Standard.\n\n#### What is a Diamond?\n\nA diamond is a contract with external functions that are supplied by contracts called facets. Facets are separate, independent contracts that can share internal functions, libraries and state variables. \n\n#### How a Diamond Works\n\nA diamond stores within it a mapping of function selector to facet address, for example selectorToFacet.\nWhen an external function is called on a diamond its fallback function is executed. The fallback function finds in the selectorToFacet mapping which facet has the function that has been called and then executes that function from the facet using delegatecall.\n\nA diamond’s fallback function and delegatecall enable a diamond to execute a facet’s external function as its own external function.\nThe msg.sender and msg.value values do not change and only the diamond’s contract storage is read and written to.\n\n#### Why the Diamond Standard for the CroSwap Ecosystem?\n\nWhy did we focus on the Diamond Standard? Our base launch feature sets BLEW away from the EVM speed limit for traditional smart contracts. Our engineers quickly realized that we would need to migrate to new patterns or be faced with cutting features.\nAdditionally, we need a framework that needs to be easily extensible. Our business development team is constantly coming up with new utilities which means we need to be able to easily support post-launch updates with minimum upgrade costs to the organization or our community.\n\nThese requirements made using the Diamond framework a no-brainer for the following reasons:\n* Only one address is exposed to the outside world thereby reducing deployment, testing, and integration costs.\n* Utilities can be introduced, maintained, or deprecated without requiring any updates to the main diamond contract. This means that our holders do not need to worry about migrating tokens and/or NFT’s when we are introducing the utilities.\n* The diamond contract and the associated facets are completely transparent on the blockchain.\n* Gas costs for the project and our holders are reduced by calling multiple contracts within a single transaction.",

It is the biggest exchange of the [BNB Chain ecosystem](https://coinmarketcap.com/view/bnb-chain/) and one of the top DEXs by market share. The exchange employs an [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) (AMM) model, allowing users to trade against a [liquidity pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool). You can become a [liquidity provider](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens) and receive LP tokens, which entitle users to a share of the exchange's trading fees.  \n\nLP token holders can also engage in [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/yield-farming) to earn [CAKE](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pancakeswap/), the exchange's [utility token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/utility-token). The token can be [staked](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) in so-called ‘Syrup Pools’ with flexible or fixed-term staking. Flexible staking allows users to unstake at any time, while fixed-term staking maximizes yield and locks up tokens for up to 52 weeks.\n\nFurthermore, PancakeSwap (V2) offers a lottery, where users can win prizes in CAKE. On the [NFT](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) marketplace, collectibles can be traded, and with the NFT Profile System, users can set up personalized profiles. There is also a [perpetual](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/perpetual-contracts) trading exchange, developed in partnership with ApolloX, that offers [futures](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/futures) trading of several popular token pairs without an expiry date. Users can trade popular token pairs with leverage to enter a bigger position than their account balance. \n\n\n## Who Are the PancakeSwap (V2) Founders?\n\nThe PancakeSwap (V2) founders are anonymous and head a two-dozen strong team of anonymous \"Chefs\" working in the exchange's \"Kitchen.\" The exchange is open-source and has been [audited](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/audit) by reputable security firms like Certik and Slowmist. \n\n\n## When Did PancakeSwap (V2) Launch?\n\nPancakeSwap (V2) launched in September 2020.\n\n\n## Where Is PancakeSwap (V2) Located?\n\nAs it is a decentralized exchange, the team works remotely.

The exchange is based on open-source software and prioritizes decentralization, [censorship resistance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/censorship-resistance) and security. It benefits from ultra-low gas prices compared to Ethereum, as well as fast and simple trading execution.    \n\nAnyone can become a [liquidity provider](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens) by depositing two tokens into a [liquidity pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool). The exchange enables the trading of [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) tokens, which are traded according to the constant product formula. The mechanism removes the need for an [order book](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/order-book) and allows traders to tap into a constant pool of liquidity. \n\nLiquidity providers can passively invest their assets to accumulate trading fees or provide liquidity as a hedge for certain trading strategies. Traders use tools like [token swaps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) or can deploy arbitrage bots to compare prices across different exchanges. Finally, developers integrate the exchange with different liquidity aggregators or [wallets](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/hot-wallet).\n\n\n## Who Are the QuickSwap Founders?\n\nQuickSwap was founded by Roc Zacharias, who is also the CEO of Lunar Digital Assets, a blockchain marketing and consultancy firm that also acts as an advisor to the exchange. It is furthermore advised by the Matic Foundation, a governing body of the Polygon blockchain. \n\n\n## When Did QuickSwap Launch?\n\nQuickSwap launched in May 2021 with over 96% of the tokens distributed to the community. It is now considered the main decentralized exchange for Polygon, a [layer-two](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-2) solution for Ethereum. \n\n\n## Where Is QuickSwap Located?\n\nThe exchange doesn’t provide any information about its headquarters.\n\n \n\n\n## QuickSwap Restricted Countries\n\nAt the time of writing, there is no information about restricted countries on this exchange.\n\n\n## QuickSwap Supported Coins List \n\nQuickSwap supports all ERC-20 tokens deployed on Polygon, including wrapped tokens like [wrapped Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-wrapped-bitcoin). \n\n\n## How Much Are QuickSwap Fees?\n\nThe exchange charges a 0.3% fee for swapping tokens, which is distributed among liquidity providers on a pro-rata basis. \n\n\n## Is It Possible to Use Leverage or Margin Trade on QuickSwap?\n\nThere is no margin or [leverage trading](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-leverage-in-crypto-trading-and-how-to-use-it) option on this exchange.

            "description": "## What Is PancakeSwap (V2)?\n\nPancakeSwap (V2) is a popular [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) (DEX) allowing [BEP-20 token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/bep-20) [swaps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) on the [BNB Chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bnb/). It is the biggest exchange of the [BNB Chain ecosystem](https://coinmarketcap.com/view/bnb-chain/) and one of the top DEXs by market share. The exchange employs an [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) (AMM) model, allowing users to trade against a [liquidity pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool). You can become a [liquidity provider](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens) and receive LP tokens, which entitle users to a share of the exchange's trading fees.  \n\nLP token holders can also engage in [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/yield-farming) to earn [CAKE](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pancakeswap/), the exchange's [utility token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/utility-token). The token can be [staked](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) in so-called ‘Syrup Pools’ with flexible or fixed-term staking. Flexible staking allows users to unstake at any time, while fixed-term staking maximizes yield and locks up tokens for up to 52 weeks.\n\nFurthermore, PancakeSwap (V2) offers a lottery, where users can win prizes in CAKE. On the [NFT](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) marketplace, collectibles can be traded, and with the NFT Profile System, users can set up personalized profiles. There is also a [perpetual](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/perpetual-contracts) trading exchange, developed in partnership with ApolloX, that offers [futures](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/futures) trading of several popular token pairs without an expiry date. Users can trade popular token pairs with leverage to enter a bigger position than their account balance. \n\n\n## Who Are the PancakeSwap (V2) Founders?\n\nThe PancakeSwap (V2) founders are anonymous and head a two-dozen strong team of anonymous \"Chefs\" working in the exchange's \"Kitchen.\" The exchange is open-source and has been [audited](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/audit) by reputable security firms like Certik and Slowmist. \n\n\n## When Did PancakeSwap (V2) Launch?\n\nPancakeSwap (V2) launched in September 2020.\n\n\n## Where Is PancakeSwap (V2) Located?\n\nAs it is a decentralized exchange, the team works remotely. However, according to Crunchbase, PancakeSwap has its headquarters in Fukuoka, Japan.\n\n \n\n\n## PancakeSwap (V2) Restricted Countries\n\nThere are no restricted countries or regions since the exchange is decentralized. However, the following countries and regions are geoblocked: Cuba, Iran, Zimbabwe, Iraq, Crimea, Syria, Sudan, Belarus and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\n\n## PancakeSwap (V2) Supported Coins List \n\nAll BEP-20 tokens can be traded, as well as several popular futures pairs, such as BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, BNB/USDT, and all other big [layer-one blockchains](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-1-blockchain).\n\n\n## How Much Are PancakeSwap (V2) Fees?\n\nAt the time of writing, token swaps incur a 0.25% trading fee, with 0.17% returned to the liquidity pools as a fee reward, 0.03% sent to the treasury and 0.05% sent towards a buyback and burn program. \n\n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trade on PancakeSwap (V2)?\n\nThe perpetual futures exchange allows leverage of up to 150X on the biggest trading pairs and 50X on smaller trading pairs.

Instead of manually searching for the best prices and executing trades on different DEXs, users can utilize a DEX aggregator to automatically route their trades to the exchange offering the most favorable prices at any given moment.

Gas fees and MEV are minimized on Vertex due to the batched transaction and optimistic rollup model of the underlying Arbitrum layer two (L2), where Vertex’s smart contracts control the risk engine and core products.\n\nVertex is non-custodial, meaning users always retain control over their assets on-chain.\nVertex boasts extremely low-latency trading and effective liquidity utilization across a broader range of DeFi assets as a byproduct of its hybrid orderbook-AMM design. The off-chain sequencer architecture also helps to minimize the Miner Extractable Value (MEV) characteristic of Ethereum L1 while enabling lightning-fast trading.\n\nThe integrated AMM is located on-chain – housed within the protocol layer. The on-chain AMM functions as the default state of the protocol controlled at the smart contract level, known as “Slo-Mo Mode.”",

            "description": "Merlin is an immutable, permission-less and community centric DEX built on ZkSync with a goal to solve what might be called the “liquidity problem”. We achieve this by creating a liquidity environment that is robust and efficient. Consequently allowing builders and users to leverage our infrastructure for deep & readily accessible liquidity. Merlin's vision is to surpass current DEX offerings and, as the first of its kind on ZkSync, set a precedent for the standards required to become the beacon of liquidity of this ecosystem and provide 'True Yields'. \n\n##Revolutionising the Potential of AMM's \n\nAutomatic market-makers (AMMs) stand as the leading innovation in the DeFi sector. This was heralded initially by Uniswap, which provided the initial logic for markets created by x·y = k. Essentially allowing for zero-assumption based pricing mechanisms that spread liquidity across all prices evenly regardless of the underlying assets. However Merlin has built what we believe to be a predecessor to this initial logic allowing us to precisely focus liquidity around any target price. Thus allowing Merlin to support both Volatile (Uniswap Style) and Stable (Curve Style) swaps, minimizing fees whilst optimizing speed and reliability.",

By utilizing the power of zkSync, ko.one provides its users with faster and cheaper transactions, as well as a robust and user-friendly platform for trading, staking, and yield farming.\n\nWith a mission to redefine the DeFi landscape, ko.one promotes community involvement and maintains a fair launch strategy to ensure genuine decentralization. The platform's token distribution aims to offer equal opportunities for all users to acquire tokens, fostering a sense of fairness and unity within the ecosystem.\n\nAs the first DEX on zkSync with official Lightning Loans, ko.one holds a unique position in the market. By harnessing zkSync's capabilities, ko.one strives to expand the possibilities within DeFi while upholding the values of the zkSync ecosystem.\n\nko.one offers numerous advantages to liquidity providers. These include exclusive access to zkSync DEX with Lightning Loans, proven in projects like Luna. The platform also aims to minimize impermanent loss for liquidity providers by non-profitably balancing token prices and protecting large assets. In the early stages, users can enjoy 100% of the 0.3% Liquidity Provider Fee, as ko.one takes no cut. Additionally, during the initial phase, there are no deposit fees for adding liquidity, with future changes determined by KO PASS card voting.\n\nOne of the key strengths of ko.one is its capital advantage. It is the only DEX on zkSync to have received mainstream capital investment, with 5-8 institutions expected to join gradually after the launch. Furthermore, ko.one leverages iSwap's technical prowess, public chain, and talent resources to become a dominant multi-chain DEX native to the zkSync network.\n\nko.one's Launchpad offers a unique multi-mode advantage that caters to various investment preferences:\n\nRegular Mode: Fundraising takes place at a fixed price, ending once the hard cap is reached.\nOver-subscription Mode: Fundraising occurs at a predetermined price without a hard cap, allowing users to invest without limits. Token distribution is based on the total amount raised and individual investment ratios.\nKO Mode: The token price increases in stages during fundraising. As more users participate, the price rises, with a hard cap limit for each project. This mode encourages early participation and sharing.\nThe platform also introduces Lightning Loans and a 5% invitation rebate, adding more value for users. By offering a comprehensive suite of services and promoting a sense of fairness and community involvement, ko.one aims to revolutionize the DeFi space and attract users seeking a more efficient and rewarding trading experience.",

The original Solidly system faced several significant issues that hindered its adoption in the Fantom ecosystem.\nVelocore has made several improvements to the Solidly codebase, all of which were thoughtfully chosen to ensure that the protocol would carry out the original intended mechanism of allowing voters to fairly compensate LPs for impermanent loss.",

This innovative protocol is designed to offer a single platform for all DeFi needs, making it a one-stop-shop for DeFi enthusiasts.\n\nThe initial implementation of the Wagmi protocol will take place on the ZKera mainnet, which is a highly secure and scalable blockchain network. This will serve as a foundation for the protocol and will be a crucial step in ensuring the stability and security of the platform. Once the protocol is thoroughly tested and refined on the ZKera mainnet, it will be deployed on other blockchain networks via omni layer allowing for greater decentralization and accessibility.\n\nThe goal of the Wagmi protocol is to bring the convenience and functionality of centralized exchanges to the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. By offering a comprehensive solution for trading, liquidity provision (LPing), swapping and strategy generation, the Wagmi protocol aims to provide users with a centralized exchange-like experience, while maintaining the security and transparency of decentralized finance. The objective is to provide DeFi users with a single platform that meets all their needs, eliminating the need to use multiple platforms and providing a seamless DeFi experience.",

It obviates the need for trusted intermediaries, prioritizing decentralization, censorship resistance, and security. \n\nEach DoveSwap smart contract, or pair, manages a liquidity pool made up of reserves of two ERC-20 tokens. \n\nAnyone can become a liquidity provider (LP) for a pool by depositing an equivalent value of each underlying token in return for pool tokens. These tokens track pro-rata LP shares of the total reserves, and can be redeemed for the underlying assets at any time.\n\nPairs act as automated market makers, standing ready to accept one token for the other as long as the “constant product” formula is preserved. This formula, most simply expressed as x * y = k, states that trades must not change the product (k) of a pair’s reserve balances (x and y). Because k remains unchanged from the reference frame of a trade, it is often referred to as the invariant. This formula has the desirable property that larger trades (relative to reserves) execute at exponentially worse rates than smaller ones.",

It is operated by the Guru Network and benefits the ELITE stakeholders from protocol revenue.\n\nThis is complemented by fully-automatic hands-free dynamic trade fee which changes on each and every single trade independently for each pool to churn the best opportunities out of volatility for the stakeholders and incentivizes higher volume with a lower fee during low-activity phases.\n\nEⅢ is the first CL AMM governed by the Solidly Principles with Fungible Liquidity instead of NFTs where 99% of fees goes to the governing protocol while the liquidity incentives (emissions) are received by it's market makers via Gauge-based Farming to encourage only the best fee-generating TVL.",

            "description": "Ramses is a new decentralized automated market maker (AMM) launching on Arbitrum. The protocol operates through the RAM token and veNFTs. Ramses incentivizes liquidity by providing token lockers with the capability to direct protocol emissions towards token pairs of their choice. In return, lockers receive an anti-dilutive rebase, a portion of the swap fees generated by their selected pairs, and any bribes directed towards these pairs.\n\nveRAM token holders are motivated to vote for pools with the highest trading volumes because these high volume pools also generate the most fees. In addition, voters are motivated to vote for pools with bribes from protocols looking to bootstrap liquidity.\n\nLPs are incentivized with emissions that translate to real yield.\n\nTraders benefit from low slippage because of the liquidity provided, in accordance with proven vAMM / sAMM tech.\n\nProtocols can utilize a liquidity layer that is designed to promote collaboration. As a result, they can benefit from capital-efficient trading conditions for their tokens. Protocols also can incentivize liquidity by offering bribes to veRAM holders during periods of low trading activity.",

            "description": "Noah Swap is an open source decentralized exchange that allows users to trade freely on the chain. It is a DeFi infrastructure open to everyone. As with most AMMs, trades between specific asset pairs are facilitated by holding reserves of both assets. It sets the transaction price between them based on the size of its reserves, and the price changes with the number of tokens in the pool. Any user is free to join or withdraw from the token liquidity pool, and becoming a liquidity provider or LP will bear part of the transaction risk in exchange for returns.",

            "description": "On the Arbitrum network, CrescentSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that provides a number of cutting-edge capabilities. It is intended to be community-driven, with flexible taxation parameters and adaptive liquidity for the benefit of both users and builders. In order to increase capital efficiency and provide novel staking strategies, the platform includes non-fungible staked positions, which work as an additional layer of functionality on top of conventional LP tokens. CrescentSwap uses a dual token system, with the natively liquid Moonlight token (MNLT) and the fully-backed Artemis Token (ARTMS), a stable-appreciating asset. With the help of this system, both holders and liquidity providers can generate long-term returns. The protocol attempts to stabilize the DeFi sector by reducing price manipulation and sustainability issues, and it is trustless and permissionless, allowing direct involvement with CrescentSwap without the team's meddling.\n\nBased on the Uni-v3 model, CrescentSwap's AMM model is highly optimized and feature-rich. For trading pairs, it includes dynamic directional fees that enable different charge rates and swap modification based on the direction of the swap. StableSwap, a Curve Finance AMM implementation that enables trading stable pairs with less slippage, is also introduced on the site. CrescentSwap further provides projects with a launchpad to permissionlessly jumpstart their token launches and liquidity. Through a deflationary token model, emission distribution, protocol earnings redistribution, buyback and burn procedures, the protocol's sustainability and lifespan are given priority. Through CrescentDAO, which allows CrescentDAO NFT holders to participate in voting and discussions, the governance and decision-making process is facilitated, providing a community-driven approach to protocol development and decision-making. CrescentSwap's overall goal is to offer DeFi merchants and projects an ecosystem that is highly effective, flexible, and long-lasting.",

We’ve seen the various evolutions in AMMs, the rise and fall of Solidly and the current rise of Solidly Summer. As the fifth largest chain in DeFi, and one with a rich history of leadership and fostering innovation, Polygon’s lack of a ve(3,3) product was an obvious problem we believed we could solve. \r\n\r\nAs believers in the forthcoming real world asset (RWA) revolution in DeFi, we identified a strategic opportunity to embrace this shift, building a product focused on the needs of protocols and users looking to invest in tokenized real world assets. There’s a huge first-mover advantage to owning this space and we’re looking to capture it.",

Liquidity Pools work similar to how pools work on DEX platforms such as Pancakeswap and Uniswap. The difference with Xeggex is that any assets we have listed can be paired together without having to wrap any assets to another blockchain. Also, since the add and remove liquidity functions do not require an on chain transaction fee, the cost of these actions are zero.  Xeggex also offers some of the industries lowest withdraw fee rates, which are based on actual network cost and are not designed for profit. Xeggex supports many different types of blockchains and tokenized assets and we continues to add more every week.",

            "description": "## What Is Uniswap?\n\nUniswap is one of the most popular cryptocurrency [decentralized exchanges](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) (DEXs), launching in November 2018. It pioneered the [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) (AMM) model, instead of the traditional order book-based used by exchanges. Uniswap runs on the Ethereum blockchain and uses a number of [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) to securely swap [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) tokens between users.\n\nThe decentralized aspect of the protocol means that there is no single centralized authority that manages and runs the exchange — instead, swaps are done in a [peer-to-peer](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/peer-to-peer-p2p) (P2P) manner. Moreover, Uniswap strives to solve the [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity) problem inherent in other exchanges. Uniswap V3 is the 3rd edition of the protocol fitted with updates to improve compensation and provide greater control and flexibility for individual LPs. Uniswap V3 supports over 46.5% of the total DEX trading volume and the protocol reached a cumulative lifetime trading volume of $1 trillion in May 2022.\n\n## Who Is the Founder of Uniswap V3\n\nUniswap was founded by Hayden Adams, a graduate of Stony Brook University and a former mechanical engineer at Siemens. Inspired by a blog and Reddit post by Vitalik Buterin, Adams received a grant from the Ethereum Foundation and launched the protocol in November 2018. Uniswap Labs raised a seed round from Paradigm and, in August 2020, received $11 million in its Series A round led by ​​Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nUniswap V3 launched in May of 2021, almost 2.5 years after the first version was released, and a year after Uniswap V2 was launched. \n\n\n## Where Is Uniswap Located?\n\nThe Uniswap protocol and Uniswap interface were developed by Uniswap Labs, which is located in New York City. As a[ decentralized finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi) (DeFi) protocol, it can be used worldwide by anyone with internet access. However, there are some restrictions depending on what country you are from. As of July 2022, Uniswap has banned 10 countries from its protocol. The list of countries includes Belarus, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Côte D'ivoire, Liberia, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Iraq and Iran.\n\n## What Coins Can Be Traded on Uniswap?\n\nAs a decentralized peer-to-peer protocol, anyone can list a token on Uniswap. The most popular trading pairs at the time of writing include [USDC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/), [Wrapped BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wrapped-bitcoin/), [WETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/weth/) and [DAI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/). \n\n## How Much Are Uniswap V3 Fees?\n\nUniswap V3 liquidity providers can initially create liquidity pools at three fee levels: 0.05%, 0.30% and 1%. More fee levels may be added through the UNI governance proposal. \n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trading on Uniswap?\n\nUniswap V3 does not offer leverage or margin trading directly on its platform.",

            "description": "XSwap Protocol is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Xinfin network. It serves as an automated liquidity protocol that enables users to exchange various XRC-20 tokens without the need for a centralized intermediary or order book.\n\nXSwap operates as a decentralized exchange, meaning it doesn't rely on traditional order books. Instead, it utilizes liquidity pools to facilitate token swaps. Users can trade various Xinfin-based tokens directly from their wallets without the need for a centralized authority. \n\nXSwap uses the concept of AMM, which involves using smart contracts to automate trading functions. Liquidity providers (LPs) deposit pairs of tokens into smart contracts, creating liquidity pools. These pools are used to facilitate trades, with prices determined algorithmically based on the ratio of the two tokens in the pool.\n\nUsers contribute to liquidity pools by depositing one or two tokens into a smart contract. In return, they receive liquidity provider (LP) tokens, representing their share of the pool. These LP tokens can be redeemed at any time, along with a portion of the trading fees generated by the pool.\n\nUsers can easily swap one XRC-20 token for another directly through XSwap's user interface or by interacting with its smart contracts. The trade is executed at the current market price determined by the AMM algorithm.\n\nXSwap is a permissionless and open-source protocol. Anyone can access and use the platform without requiring approval. \n\nXSP is the governance token of the XSwap Protocol. Holders of XSP can participate in the decision-making process by voting on proposals related to the protocol's development and parameters.\n\nXSwap serves as the first launchpad within the XDC network, providing a comprehensive suite of services including token creation, presale initiation, token and liquidity locker, and multisender functionality for all XRC20 tokens. Additionally, XSwap features a robust farming platform and extends its services to include a mobile wallet for user convenience.\n\nXSwap plays a pivotal role in the growth of decentralized finance by providing a user-friendly, permissionless, and efficient way for users to trade a wide variety of tokens directly from their wallets.",

            "description": "## What Is PancakeSwap (V2)?\n\nPancakeSwap (V2) is a popular [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) (DEX) allowing [BEP-20 token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/bep-20) [swaps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) on the [BNB Chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bnb/). It is the biggest exchange of the [BNB Chain ecosystem](https://coinmarketcap.com/view/bnb-chain/) and one of the top DEXs by market share. The exchange employs an [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) (AMM) model, allowing users to trade against a [liquidity pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool). You can become a [liquidity provider](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens) and receive LP tokens, which entitle users to a share of the exchange's trading fees.  \n\nLP token holders can also engage in [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/yield-farming) to earn [CAKE](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pancakeswap/), the exchange's [utility token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/utility-token).

            "description": "Founded in 2023, NonKYC.io strives to provide its users with the best trading experience and give small and medium market cap assets a reliable trading hub. Our goal is to maintain a fast and user friendly system while also concentrating on security to keep users, data, and assets safe. Security of our users' data & assets is always our top priority and we are focused on building an easy to use digital asset trading platform for everyone to enjoy.\r\n\r\nThe NonKYC platform system is NOT from some predesigned script package or preexisting codebase. It has been created from the ground up by professional developers who are well experienced in Cryptocurrency. NonKYC has been designed to scale horizontally as we grow to become a top tier exchange.\r\n\r\nSafe\r\nWe run audits on our security system and employ multiple third party and internal backend audit systems on the exchange to keep the funds of our users safe and secure.\r\nFast\r\nWe strive to be a leading blockchain company and to provide fast and efficient real-time transactions. This ensures our users can deposit and withdraw their digital assets quickly.\r\nFriendly\r\nUser experience is another top priority. We strive to provide our users with an easy to understand trading experience and welcome any feedback our users may have.\r\nReliable\r\nWe work hard to make sure our services always work when you need them. We make full backups of our systems every four hours and store them in a separate secure facility.\r\nCross-crypto deposit addresses\r\nThe same address is used for the same series of cryptocurrencies, which effectively reduces the user's asset loss caused by incorrect deposits. For example, ETH, BSC, ERC-20, BSC-20 all have the same deposit address. This allows for less confusion when depositing your funds.\r\n\r\nHot and cold wallet storage\r\nMost assets exceeding a threshold value are stored in off-site cold wallets, while a small amount of digital currencies are kept in hot wallets. This ensures the safety of the user’s assets while allowing for fast withdrawals.\r\n\r\nMulti-factor authentication\r\nMulti-factor verification when logging in and withdrawing assets to help keep users safe.\r\n\r\nSystem backups\r\nWe make backups of all user wallets, databases, and code every 4 hours, which are stored in a separate secure facility and retained for at least 30 days. All data can be easily restored even if the servers are damaged. We also make a user balances snapshot once per hour as part of the backup process. The database is backed up in two separate ways and stored in two separate locations. One is a point in time snapshot backups, which is considered the be the authoritive backup. The other is a full dump backup and stored in a different location.\r\n\r\nServer Security\r\nWe do not use password authentication on any of our servers. We make effective use of firewalls and employ login failure banning. We use strong randomly generated password for all rpc endpoints. Daemon processes run in a very limited user environment and cannot access other information on the same machine. The front end website has no direct access to any wallet RPC ports.\r\n\r\nReal-time asset transfers\r\nWe support fast deposits and withdrawals (Generally within 2 minutes). We use dynamic withdrawal fees based on the current state of the network. We are proud to maintain some of the lowest withdraw fees in the industry.\r\n\r\nInsurance Wallet\r\nWe've got your back with our insurance wallet! Every trade on our exchange contributes to this safety net, providing peace of mind in case of a security breach. We value privacy and anonymity, but never compromise on security. Our team works tirelessly to stay ahead of potential threats and ensure your funds are protected. Join nonkyc.io today for a secure and reliable platform to trade cryptocurrency.",

            "description": "## What is PayCash Swap?\n\nLaunched in 2021, PayCash is a decentralized financial ecosystem implemented on the basis of smart contracts on the EOS blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrency exchanges, ecosystem users can directly interact with its smart contracts. A key feature of this ecosystem is the ability to use any cryptocurrency wallets or applications that can operate on the EOS blockchain.\n\n## PayCash Swap launch chronology\n\n2018 - the birth of an idea and concept;\n2019 - 2020 - detailed development of the concept;\n2020 - creation of the PayCash application and the website paycashswap.com;\nQ1 2021 - beta launch of the project;\nQ3 2021 - launch of the PayCash ecosystem.\n\n## What is included in the PayCash Swap ecosystem?\n\nThe infrastructure of the ecosystem includes crypto-wallets PayCash Wallet, Malinka Wallet, Kalyna Wallet, smart contracts responsible for the autonomous functioning of decentralized services, and native tokens.\n\nAll crypto wallets in the ecosystem include a legacy function, which, after a user-defined period of inactivity, automatically distributes funds between successor wallets. For each native token, the inheritance function is configured separately.\n\nThe ecosystem also implements a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange function, the logic of which is based on the AMM (automated market maker) model in one of 10 smart contracts.\n\nFor secure communication and exchange of information between users, a crypto messenger is built into each crypto wallet in the ecosystem. Only the sender and recipient have access to the conversation, since access to the account is impossible without the private key. If a user deletes his account from the application or logs in from another device, then outgoing messages in the crypto chat are displayed in encrypted form.\n\n## Native tokens\n\nThere are several native tokens on the platform:\n\nMalinka token (MLNK) is a cryptocurrency received by users as a reward for adding liquidity for conversion or issuing USDCASH. A total of 26,250,000,000 Malinka tokens (MLNK) were issued on the EOS blockchain, of which 1,000,000,000 are the investment premine, which paid for the development of the infrastructure of the PayCashSwap service, 25,250,000,000 are distributed among users-liquidity providers and will be completed on August 29 2081.\n\nUSDCASH stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that is fully pegged to the US dollar exchange rate. The USDCASH stablecoin is issued by a smart contract secured by liquidity (USDT - MLNK pair) contributed by the user to a special collateral pool. The multiple of the emission lot is 100 USDCASH.\n\nStablecoin RUBLES is a cryptocurrency fully backed by fiat rubles. The collateral is fully deposited in commercial bank accounts.",

If you want to read more about the dYdX Chain reward mechanisms read this [blog](https://www.dydx.foundation/blog/understanding-rewards-and-fees-on-the-dydx-chain).\n\nAs a PoS blockchain the dYdX Chain requires a layer 1 token to secure and govern the network. The dYdX community [voted](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0x17026e18317dc29fe745d3130246a83b1485612da9c97e7261e8f659cf33663c) to adopt DYDX as the L1 protocol token for the dYdX Chain on September 2, 2023.\n\nHolders of the DYDX token can use their tokens to run a Validator or stake their tokens to a Validator in order to participate in securing and governing the dYdX Chain network.\n\n## Who Are the Founders of dYdX?\n\n[Antonio Juliano](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoniojuliano/) — an experienced programmer with a background in blockchain technology is the founder and CEO of dYdX.

The dYdX Chain is a proof-of-stake blockchain network and, as such, it requires a Layer 1 (“L1”) protocol token for staking to validators in order to secure the chain and for stakers of the L1 token to govern the network. \n\nThe [wethDYDX Smart Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x46b2deae6eff3011008ea27ea36b7c27255ddfa9) enables the migration of ethDYDX from Ethereum to the dYdX Chain. When interacted with, the wethDYDX Smart Contract would carry out the following functions in a fully permissionless and automated manner: Receive and permanently lock the ethDYDX tokens sent by the user to the wethDYDX Smart Contract; Send a wrapped version of the Ethereum-based DYDX token (“wethDYDX”) to the user on a 1-1 proportional basis on Ethereum; and dYdX Chain Validators can also read and ingest the information in the wethDYDX Smart Contract such that corresponding DYDX can be distributed to users by Validators on the dYdX Chain once there is confirmation that Step 1 above is complete and the ethDYDX is permanently locked in the wethDYDX Smart Contract. More information about the migration of ethDYDX from Ethereum to dYdX Chain is available [here](http://docs.dydx.community/dydx-token-migration/start-here/introduction).",

            "description": "SynFutures is a leading perp DEX that creates an open and trustless derivatives market by enabling trading on anything with a price feed anytime. \n\nSynFutures democratizes the derivatives market by employing an Amazon-like business model, giving users the tools to trade any assets freely and list arbitrary futures contracts within seconds. With its groundbreaking one-of-a-kind market-making model, Oyster AMM, SynFutures combines the best of the order book and AMM to maximize capital efficiency and appeal to a broad range of traders and investors. \n\nDeployed on multiple blockchains, SynFutures was named one of the largest derivative exchanges on Polygon and is among the top three most actively used decentralized derivative exchanges in Web3. Backers include Tier 1 Web3 institutional investors Pantera Capital, Polychain Capital, Susquehanna International Group (SIG), Dragonfly Capital, Standard Crypto, and Framework Ventures. Team members have extensive experience at global financial institutions, fintech companies, and blockchain technology companies, such as Alipay, Bitmain, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Matrixport, and Nomura Securities. \n\nSynFutures recently completed its Series B funding round, securing an additional $22 million and bringing heir total funding raised to $38 million.\n\nWhat is SynFutures V3?\nV3 is SynFutures’ most significant protocol update. Oyster AMM. Oyster AMM builds upon the foundational architecture established in previous versions of SynFutures while welcoming a variety of features catered to the needs of everyday traders and professional participants. Oyster AMM is designed to blend the simplicity of automated market-making harmoniously with the efficiency of order book models, creating a seamless experience for newcomers and seasoned professionals.\n\nKey Features of Oyster AMM:\n\nSingle-Token Concentrated Liquidity for Derivatives: Oyster AMM facilitates liquidity concentration within specific price ranges and incorporates leverage to boost capital efficiency. Unlike spot market-focused liquidity models, it introduces a margin management and liquidation framework tailored for derivatives, using a single token to streamline the trading ecosystem.\n\nA Fully Onchain Order Book: While AMMs democratize market access, they demand significant liquidity for equivalent price impact compared to order book models. To address this, SynFutures V3 introduces an onchain order book model and its CL AMM, ensuring transparency, trustlessness, and anti-censorship, eliminating dependence on centralized administrators.\n\nA Single Model for Unified Liquidity: Oyster AMM integrates concentrated liquidity and order book into a single model, offering unified liquidity tailored to active traders and passive liquidity providers. This cohesive approach ensures efficient atomic transactions and avoids non-synchronization issues in dual-process execution systems.\n\nStabilization Mechanism for User Protection: The Oyster AMM introduces advanced financial risk management mechanisms to enhance user protection and price stability. These mechanisms include a dynamic penalty fee system discouraging price manipulation and balancing the LP's risk-reward profile.\n\nFind out more about SynFutures at https://www.synfutures.com/",

            "description": "## What Is Uniswap (V2)?\n\nUniswap is a [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) (DEX) which first introduced the [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) (AMM) model. Unlike with an [order book](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/order-book), traders are provided with constant liquidity thanks to the “constant product” formula. The V2 version was first based on [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), before branching out to other blockchains that support [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) tokens.\n\nWhile the V1 version of Uniswap only supported [swapping](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) ETH-ERC-20 token pairs, the V2 version did away with this bridging problem and introduced flash swaps. These allowed users to swap between different ERC-20 tokens without incurring too much [slippage](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/slippage). It also introduced protocol fees, which contributed to the platform's ongoing development. Furthermore, the V2 version began using [wrapped Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-wrapped-ethereum-weth) over native Ether for its core contracts. \n\nThe exchange’s popularity gave birth to a V3 version with concentrated liquidity and more flexible fees, which improved the user experience for traders and liquidity providers alike. \n\n\n## Who Is the Founder of Uniswap (V2)?\n\nHayden Adams, a former mechanical engineer at Siemens and Stony Brook University graduate, founded the platform in November 2018. The company behind the DEX raised a seed round from Paradigm and $11 million in a Series A round led by ​​Andreessen Horowitz.\n\n\n## When Did Uniswap (V2) Launch?\n\nUniswap’s V1 version was a proof-of-concept first launched in November 2018, and later improved with the introduction of the V2 version in August 2020. The V3 version in May 2021 marks the current final iteration of the exchange.\n\n\n## Where Is Uniswap (V2) Located?\n\nUniswap Labs, the company behind the decentralized exchange, is headquartered in New York City. \n\n\n## Uniswap (V2) Restricted Countries\n\nAs of July 2022, Uniswap has banned users from 10 countries that are sanctioned by the U.S. government, including Belarus, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Côte d'Ivoire, Liberia, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Iraq and Iran.\n\n\n## Uniswap (V2) Supported Coins List \n\nAs a permissionless decentralized exchange, tokens can be freely listed by anyone providing liquidity to trade them. The most liquid tokens at the time of writing include stablecoins and wrapped tokens like [USDC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/), [Wrapped BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wrapped-bitcoin/), [wETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/weth/) and [DAI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/). \n\n\n## How Much Are Uniswap (V2) Fees?\n\nThe exchange’s V2 version charges 0.3% per token swap. 0.05% goes to the protocol and 0.25% is allocated to [liquidity providers](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens).\n\n\n## Is It Possible to Use Leverage or Margin Trade on Uniswap (V2)?\n\nUniswap V2 does not offer leverage or margin trading.",

            "description": "## What Is Uniswap (V2)?\n\nUniswap is a [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) (DEX) which first introduced the [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) (AMM) model. Unlike with an [order book](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/order-book), traders are provided with constant liquidity thanks to the “constant product” formula. The V2 version was first based on [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), before branching out to other blockchains that support [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) tokens.\n\nWhile the V1 version of Uniswap only supported [swapping](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) ETH-ERC-20 token pairs, the V2 version did away with this bridging problem and introduced flash swaps. These allowed users to swap between different ERC-20 tokens without incurring too much [slippage](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/slippage). It also introduced protocol fees, which contributed to the platform's ongoing development. Furthermore, the V2 version began using [wrapped Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-wrapped-ethereum-weth) over native Ether for its core contracts. \n\nThe exchange’s popularity gave birth to a V3 version with concentrated liquidity and more flexible fees, which improved the user experience for traders and liquidity providers alike. \n\n\n## Who Is the Founder of Uniswap (V2)?\n\nHayden Adams, a former mechanical engineer at Siemens and Stony Brook University graduate, founded the platform in November 2018. The company behind the DEX raised a seed round from Paradigm and $11 million in a Series A round led by ​​Andreessen Horowitz.\n\n\n## When Did Uniswap (V2) Launch?\n\nUniswap’s V1 version was a proof-of-concept first launched in November 2018, and later improved with the introduction of the V2 version in August 2020. The V3 version in May 2021 marks the current final iteration of the exchange.\n\n\n## Where Is Uniswap (V2) Located?\n\nUniswap Labs, the company behind the decentralized exchange, is headquartered in New York City. \n\n\n## Uniswap (V2) Restricted Countries\n\nAs of July 2022, Uniswap has banned users from 10 countries that are sanctioned by the U.S. government, including Belarus, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Côte d'Ivoire, Liberia, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Iraq and Iran.\n\n\n## Uniswap (V2) Supported Coins List \n\nAs a permissionless decentralized exchange, tokens can be freely listed by anyone providing liquidity to trade them. The most liquid tokens at the time of writing include stablecoins and wrapped tokens like [USDC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/), [Wrapped BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wrapped-bitcoin/), [wETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/weth/) and [DAI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/). \n\n\n## How Much Are Uniswap (V2) Fees?\n\nThe exchange’s V2 version charges 0.3% per token swap. 0.05% goes to the protocol and 0.25% is allocated to [liquidity providers](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens).\n\n\n## Is It Possible to Use Leverage or Margin Trade on Uniswap (V2)?\n\nUniswap V2 does not offer leverage or margin trading.",

            "description": "## What Is MonoSwap?\n\nMonoSwap is described as a decentralized exchange (DEX) operating on the Blast chain, featuring custom-built functionalities and gamification elements. As one of the pioneering automated market makers (AMM) on Blast, MonoSwap maintains its own liquidity pools and offers various services such as token swapping, liquidity provision, yield farming, and launchpad. Users can also create customized farming pools with customizable incentives and access additional yield-boosting features.\n\nUtilizing Blast's yield framework, MonoSwap compounds native yield, gas revenue shares, and a portion of its earnings to users in the form of MUSD - an over-collateralized token that is fully backed by Blast's USDB. The platform implements a point system to gauge users' engagement on-chain, with weekly MUSD distributions based on accrued points.\n\nMonoSwap enables users to execute token trades at low fees and provides opportunities to earn a portion of trading fees by supplying liquidity to both V3 and V2 AMMs.\n\n## Who Are the Founders of MonoSwap?\n\nThe MonoSwap founders are anonymous and lead a team of 10 working on the protocol with the core contributors who worked at Gameloft and ONUS. MonoSwap is open-source and partnered with a set of projects in the ecosystem.\n\n## When Did MonoSwap Launch?\n\nThe protocol launched in late February 2024, since the first day of Blast mainnet launch.\n\n## Where Is MonoSwap Located?\n\nAs a decentralized exchange, the team works remotely. However, the headquarters is located in Hanoi, Vietnam.\n\n## MonoSwap Supported Coins List\n\nAs a permissionless decentralized exchange, tokens can be freely listed by anyone providing liquidity to trade them. The initially supported tokens include ETH and USDB.",

Instead of manually searching for the best prices and executing trades on different DEXs, users can utilize a DEX aggregator to automatically route their trades to the exchange offering the most favorable prices at any given moment.

We constantly test the user experience felt by people who are not really familiar with finance or crypto and keep enhancing the experiences. Coinavenir’s futures may not be in the most technical or most coins. Hence the user base is quite different from other older exchanges.\n\nEvery asset deposited automatically moves into the cold wallet. The movement from cold to hot is processed with shorter period to reduce the danger of security breach.\n\nOnly the users with KYC done are able to trade and withdraw in order to comply.",

            "description": "Web3.World is an Automated Market Maker, Yield Farming, and Staking platform built on Venom blockchain. It is currently the most flexible Automated Market Maker launched on Venom blockchain and enables seamless trading by pooling liquidity from investors with stablecoin pairs support. It is the first DEX established on Venom blockchain.\n\n### Description\n\nWeb3.World is a decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Venom blockchain. It allows users to exchange tokens through automated liquidity pools, and also offers customizable farming rewards for each pair. Users can create their own farming pools and set rewards with any tokens. Individual developers and projects can use the Builder section of the DEX to create their own tokens, while corporate partners can use the Vesting section to calculate and set up token distribution.\n\nWeb3.World is fully decentralized and non-custodial, meaning funds are held in permissionless smart contract accounts that can only be withdrawn in exchange for another asset or by the liquidity owners in exchange for their Pool Tokens. The exchange's smart contracts are also fully permissionless and immutable, meaning any account can create a pool and no account has authority over the pool's assets or functionality, and the contracts cannot be updated or deleted.\n\nThe exchange charges a standard fee of 0.3% for token swaps (0.15% for stablecoin swaps), but users who add liquidity to the platform can earn all swapping fees in the form of a fee reward for liquidity providers.\n\n### Fees\n\nThere are 2 types of swap fees:\n\nStable pairs — 0.15%\nRegular pairs — 0.3%\n\nFor main valuable pairs Web3.World does not allocate any share of the commission apart from the LP thus rewarding the liquidity providers to the fullest extent.\n\nFees are collected from every swap transaction that takes place on Web3.World and are distributed among the LPs who have deposited into the relevant liquidity pool. If a swap transaction is routed through multiple pairs, the commission is taken on each portion of the transaction separately and rewarded to the corresponding LPs, ensuring that they are also rewarded in proportion to their contribution\n\n### Stable Swap Feature\n\nLower Slippage for Stablecoin Pairs on Web3World DeFi and DEX Platforms\n\nAutomated Market Maker (AMM) is widely recognized for its efficient application to swaps paired with stablecoins and for providing liquidity for long-tail assets. However, trading directly through the AMM on DEX platforms can result in slippage due to high trading volume, causing delays in transactions and affecting the fees. To address this issue, Web3World offers a special algorithm for stablecoin swaps to guarantee lower slippage compared to other DEX platforms.\n\nHow Does the Special Algorithm Work?\n\nWeb3World's special AMM formula helps to reduce slippage for stablecoin swaps by maintaining a close ratio to parity (1:1). The formula for stable swaps is more complex and configurable to ensure seamless swaps without affecting the price. The curve flattens the prices, ensuring minimal slippage even if the market ratio changes.\n\n### W3W Token Distribution\n\nWeb3.World tokenomics is meticulously designed to foster a sustainable and thriving ecosystem. With a total token supply capped at 200,000,000, the distribution strategy ensures a balanced allocation among liquidity providers, partners, the protocol itself, market makers, DAO reserves, the project team, early backers, and initiatives for community and marketing efforts.\n\nLiquidity Mining\n\nA significant portion of the tokens, precisely 42,250,000 (21.13% of the total supply), is allocated to liquidity mining. This initiative encourages users to provide liquidity to trading pairs, enhancing market depth and price stability. Tokens are distributed linearly over 48 months, incentivizing long-term participation in the ecosystem.\n\nPartnerships\n\nTo foster collaborations that drive expansion and integration within the Web3.World ecosystem, 26,000,000 tokens (13.00% of the total supply) are reserved for partnerships. These tokens vest linearly over 36 months, supporting sustained growth and development.\n\nProtocol Liquidity\n\nA dedicated pool of 24,375,000 tokens (12.19% of the total supply) ensures the protocol maintains sufficient liquidity. This liquidity is pivotal for executing trades efficiently and minimizing slippage for users.\n\nMarket Making\n\nTo maintain market stability and liquidity, 22,000,000 tokens (11.00% of the total supply) are allocated for market making. Immediately upon the token generation event (TGE), 10% of this pool is available, with the remainder distributed linearly over 24 months.\n\nDAO Reserves\n\nThe DAO reserves comprise 26,000,000 tokens (13.00% of the total supply). They fund future initiatives and projects the community approves through governance voting. These tokens vest linearly over 60 months, ensuring the community has a long-term stake in the platform's future.\n\nTeam\n\nAcknowledging the team's contribution to developing and supporting the platform, 24,000,000 tokens (12.00% of the total supply) are allocated to the team. These tokens vest linearly over 24 months, aligning team incentives with the ecosystem's long-term success.\n\nEarly Backers\n\nEarly backers who took initial risks and supported the project are rewarded with 11,000,000 tokens (5.50% of the total supply). To align interests, 5% of these tokens are available at TGE, with the remainder vesting linearly over 36 months.\n\nCommunity & Marketing\n\nTo engage and expand the community, 24,375,000 tokens (12.19% of the total supply) are earmarked for community and marketing efforts. Of these, 5% are available at TGE, with the rest distributed linearly over 24 months.\n.\n### Web3.World Boosted Farming\n\nBoosted farming has become an increasingly popular way for investors to increase their APR rewards on cryptocurrency farming platforms. Boosted farms on Web3.World DEX allows for an increased APR reward to be gained by holding, staking, and voting with the vested escrow token - which is veW3W token on the Web3.World platform.\n\nThere are three main ways to increase APR rewards in Web3.World boosted farming mechanism.\n\nThe first is by effectively locking LP tokens for a certain period. The longer the locking time and the bigger the amount, the higher the percentage of the reward distribution.\n\nThe second is through $W3W deposit process, which allows to receive up to x2 APR boost and in addition veW3W tokens (vested escrow token)\n\nThe third – is through the voting process, which allows vested escrow token holders to vote on which farming pools will get additional APR.\n\n### How to Set Up Venom Wallet\n\nTo use the Web3.World platform, you will need to follow the steps outlined below:\n* Install the Venom wallet by following the instructions on the [Venom Foundation website](https://venom.foundation/wallet.html).\n* Create a registered Venom wallet account. You can find instructions on how to do this on the Venom Foundation website. [Read here](https://docs.venom.foundation/general/create-a-new-wallet-account).\n* Obtain some Venom tokens ($VENOM) to pay for gas fees, which are required for processing transactions on the blockchain. You can find more information on how to acquire Venom tokens on the Venom Foundation website. [Read here](https://docs.web3.world/getting-started/how-to-get-venom).\n\nOnce you have completed these steps, you will be ready to use the Web3.World platform and take advantage of its automated market making, yield farming, and staking capabilities.",

            "description": "### What is Digitra.com?\n\nDigitra.com is a global digital assets centralized exchange. It was born to bring the convergence between Traditional and Digital Assets ecosystems, with reliable systems provided by top tier global suppliers, compliance frameworks and regulatory engagement.\n\nDigitra.com is backed by partnerships with world class institutions as NASDAQ (first digital assets exchange to use Nasdaq Universal Matching Service engine globally), Fireblocks (Multi-layer security providing one-of-a-kind insurance policy that covers digital assets), and Veriff (AIpowered identity verification and KYC solution, with a fraud prevention engine).\n\n### Who are Digitra.com founders?\n\nDigitra.com executes this convergence led by a seasoned executive with hands-on experience in the market. Digitra.com’s founder Rodrigo Batista is the former CEO (2013-2018), founder and controlling shareholder of Mercado Bitcoin, then the largest crypto exchange in Latin America, which he took from zero to 1.2 million clients in 5 years. Rodrigo sold his stake in the company in 2019.\n\nRodrigo is also the co-founder of the token issuer nTokens, the technology infrastructure company Atris, the security tokens exchange Estar, and the insurance company 88i. All these businesses are connected with the crypto and tokenization universe.\n\nThrough the advisory of Rothschild & Co, Profitus Fund, owned by Ricardo Villela Marino, the controlling partner of Itaú Bank, has invested 5 million dollars in Digitra.com in May 2022.\n\n### When Did Digitra.com launch?\n\nThe exchange was launched in August 2022. In May 2023 its native token (DGTA) was launched, which is at core of its business model.\n\n### What coins are supported on Digitra.com?\n\nThe exchange lists over 30 cryptocurrencies and supports more than 60 trading pairs, including BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, DOGE, TON, ADA and DGTA, among others.\n\n### How much are Digitra.com fees?\n\nTrading fees for any crypto pair on Digitra.com is 0.1% for market makers and 0.5% for market takers.\n\n### How is  Digitra.com traction/growth?\n\nSince the Digitra.com platform was launched in Aug/22, there were +150,000 downloads of the app, +150,000 people registered, from 200 countries, with +95,000 completing the KYC process. Digitra.com community engagement has been increasing steadily reaching ~6,000 members at Telegram.\n\n### What is Digitra.com Token (DGTA)?\n\nDGTA (Digitra.com Token) is an ERC-20 utility token based on the Ethereum blockchain with a maximum supply of 300 million units minted at once. DGTA is Digitra.com's loyalty program, fuelling the exchange’s ecosystem across the board, which represents its main utility.\n\nDGTA holders benefit from the exchange’s business performance given that Digitra.com uses part of its revenues to buy DGTA tokens on the market and burn them (Buyback & Burn program).\n\nAt the beginning, DGTA granted fee discounts to holders, similar to other exchange tokens in the market. However, it evolved to a loyalty program, in which holders get rewards throughout their journey at Digitra.com:\n\n* Creating account airdrop\n* Referring new customers airdrop\n* Getting more DGTA by only holding it at the platform\n* Getting more DGTA by providing liquidity at DGTA order book through open limit orders\n* Getting more DGTA by trading any crypto at the platform (daily Trade to Earn airdrop program)\n* DGTA holders benefit from the exchange’s business performance given that Digitra.com uses part of its revenues to buy DGTA tokens on the market and burn them (monthly Buyback & Burn program)\n\nOne important characteristic of DGTA tokens is that the number of tokens airdropped by each program is fixed, thus limiting the supply of tokens over the time.\n\nAdditionally,  in the near future, DGTA holders will benefit from access to new products and new commercial initiatives.\n\nAs mentioned before, customers get DGTA for free in three ways:\n\nOpening an account: 100 tokens are airdropped every hour among all new customers. Digitra.com allocated up to 32,600,000 DGTA to this airdrop.\n\n15,000 tokens are airdropped daily, divided between the order books available on the platform. The tokens allocated to the order book are divided among the traders in that book, as follows: 75% of the distribution goes to the customers who traded the most, and the remaining 25% is distributed equally among all customers trading in that order book. Digitra.com allocated up to 28,893,000 DGTA to this airdrop.\n\n5,000 tokens are airdropped daily, of which 1,000 are distributed equally among all referred customers, and 4,000 to referrers. The top referrers get 3,000 according to the number of referrals they make, and 1,000 is distributed equally among all referrers in a given day. The referred customer needs to trade at least US$ 5 to both the referrer and the referee to receive the reward. The referral program is under the 60,000,000 DGTA for Marketing & Liquidity allocation.\n\nBurn & Buyback Policy\n\nAs an initiative to benefit holders and promote deflation, Digitra.com will regularly burn certain amounts of DGTA. Also, Digitra.com will regularly buyback certain amounts of DGTA, which may be added to the burn amount alongside fees in DGTA collected in the period.  \n\nDGTA Trading\n\nDTGA is available for trading at Digitra.com on two order books: DGTA-USDT and DGTA-BRL. DGTA is also available for trading at Uniswap on DGTA-ETH liquidity pool.",

            "description": "Automated Market Makers (AMMs) currently encounter a notable challenge – they\nstruggle to effectively encourage the long-term success of blockchain projects. The\nproblem arises because token creators are encouraged to prioritize profits by rapidly\nwithdrawing liquidity and discreetly selling tokens. Liquidity providers tend to prefer\nshort-term commitments, withdrawing and selling their liquidity as token value rises.\nThis misalignment in structure hampers the growth of projects designed for long-term\nsuccess. Addressing this challenge is vital, as the current AMM model lacks the necessary incentives to foster continuous growth and resilience in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThe current AMM standard incurs a 0.3% fee on every swap paid in tokens. The Ethervista\nstandard is the first to set a custom fee paid only in native ETH. This fee is cleverly distributed among all liquidity providers and token creators within a specific pool, every swap,\nusing a novel mechanism which allows us to distribute rewards to millions of users with minimal gas cost. The creator fee is a protocol fee which can be assigned to a smart contract\nand treasury. Various use cases include auto-buys, staking rewards and many other DeFi\napplications. A key feature to this model is that market makers and creators benefit from\ntransaction volume rather than token price, incentivizing longevity over short-sighted price\naction. Investors benefit from a delayed liquidity removal mechanism, preventing developers\nfrom quickly rug-pulling. This approach not only mitigates the risk of sudden market upheaval but also enhances the overall success of their investments.\nBeyond, Ethervista is set to expand beyond traditional pools, moving towards building ETHBTC-USDC pools to offer lending, futures, and fee-less flashloans, aiming to become an\nall-in-one decentralized application.",

            "description": "BTX Representative: BTX Exchange is an innovative cryptocurrency platform with security and user profitability at its core. What sets us apart from other platforms is our commitment to safeguarding users' assets through advanced technology and strategic financial backing. We have a $100 million reserve fund and received a $20 million investment from the Palau government in our Series A round, which gives us the financial strength to provide a secure and stable trading environment. Notably, BTX has obtained the world's only cryptocurrency payment license issued by the Palau government, and one of only two cryptocurrency exchange operating licenses issued by Palau (the other was granted to Binance). Our mission is to create a platform that balances security, profitability, and user satisfaction.\n\nBTX Representative: BTX was founded by a group of seasoned professionals who recognized the need for a more secure and user-centric trading platform in the market. Our development journey includes several key milestones, such as securing significant financial backing and implementing advanced security protocols. The $20 million investment from the Palau government during our Series A round was a pivotal moment, providing us with the resources to develop a platform that is both innovative and highly secure. Along the way, we overcame challenges related to regulatory compliance and ensuring the scalability of our technology, all of which were essential in establishing BTX as the trusted exchange it is today.\n\nBTX Representative: Security is our top priority. We employ state-of-the-art technology to ensure the safety of our users' assets. In addition to security, our financial stability, particularly the $100 million reserve fund, instills confidence in our platform. We also focus on user profitability by offering a series of reward mechanisms across three key areas: registration, invitation, and trading. For instance, new users receive token rewards just for signing up, and by depositing $10 and trading $8 daily on BTX, they can earn 10 AI tokens. Our invitation program is also highly attractive, offering a 15% rebate on trading fees for users who invite friends to register and trade. Moreover, we have an Affiliate program where partners can earn up to 70% in transaction fee rebates. Currently, we are hosting an Invitation Carnival event where users can receive a 30% new user registration bonus for inviting others.\n\nBTX Representative: In just one month since its launch, BTX has already garnered over 40,000 registered users. This achievement has allowed us to successfully meet the second stage goal outlined in our deck. It’s a significant validation of our platform and strategic direction, demonstrating strong market and user confidence in the security and profitability solutions we offer.\n\nBTX Representative: To support BTX's ongoing development, we have established a $500,000 development autonomy fund. Individuals who propose effective suggestions, development strategies, or make significant contributions, and whose ideas are adopted, will receive cash rewards ranging from $1,000 to $10,000. Additionally, these contributors will have the opportunity to become global senior partners of the exchange, receiving original shares and enjoying dividends and other senior privileges. This initiative not only encourages active community participation but also ensures continuous innovation and growth.\n\nBTX Representative: The inspiration behind BTX was to create a platform that is unmatched in terms of security and user profitability. Our long-term goal is to establish BTX as a leading global exchange, one that not only provides a secure trading environment but also maximizes user profitability. We plan to achieve this by continually upgrading our platform, integrating new technologies, and expanding our product offerings to meet the dynamic demands of the crypto market, thereby growing our user base.\n\nBTX Representative: At BTX, user experience is our top priority. We offer an intuitive interface and a powerful mobile app, enabling users to trade anytime, anywhere. In addition to ease of use, we focus on making the platform more profitable for users. From the moment users register, they start earning rewards, and they can continue to benefit from our reward mechanisms through trading and inviting others. These features, combined with our secure infrastructure, make BTX the preferred choice for many traders.\n\nBTX Representative: Our founding team is led by Richard Wilson, who has extensive experience in both traditional finance and blockchain technology. Richard’s background in asset management and financial technology has been crucial in shaping BTX’s strategic direction, ensuring our focus on security, innovation, and user profitability. This combination of expertise has allowed us to build a platform that not only meets the highest standards of security and compliance but also offers significant financial incentives to our users.\n\nBTX Representative: Looking ahead, we plan to continue enhancing the platform’s security and user profitability, introducing more new features and updates. Our strategic goals include expanding our reward programs, launching new trading pairs, and integrating advanced AI-driven tools to help users maximize their returns. We are committed to evolving our products continuously, maintaining our competitive edge, and consistently delivering value to our users to ensure that BTX remains a leader in the rapidly changing crypto market.\n\nBTX aims to transcend the role of a mere trading platform. We are poised to contribute significantly to the advancement of blockchain technology through the forthcoming launch of BTX Chain. BTX Chain will provide a cutting-edge, secure infrastructure for decentralized applications and smart contracts, fostering innovation and driving global progress in blockchain technology. We are confident that the introduction of BTX Chain will usher in transformative changes within the blockchain space, further solidifying our position as a leader in the industry.",
